    <div>Transcriber’s Note:</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>The text is annotated with numerous footnotes, which were numbered
sequentially on each page. On occasion, a footnote itself is
annotated by a note, using an asterisk as the reference. This
distinction is followed here. Those ‘notes on notes’ are
given alphabetic sequence (A, B., etc.), and are positioned directly
following the main note.</p>

<p class='c001'>Since there are over 1500 notes in this volume, they have been
gathered at each chapter’s end, and resequenced for each chapter.
Links are provided to navigate from the reference to the note,
and back.</p>

<p class='c001'>The notes are a combination of those of the author, and of the
editor of this edition. The latter are enclosed in square brackets.</p>

<p class='c001'>Finally, the pagination of the original edition, published in the
1820’s, was preserved by Crooke for ease of reference by including those
page numbers in the text, also enclosed in square brackets.</p>

<p class='c001'>Crooke’s plan for the renovation of the Tod’s original text, including
a discussion of the transliteration of Hindi words, is
given in detail in the <a href='http://www.gutenberg.org/files/57374/57374-h/57374-h.htm#Page_ix'>Preface</a>. It should be noted that
the use of the macron to guide pronunciation is very unevenly followed,
and there was no intent here to regularize it.</p>

<p class='c001'>There are a number of references to a map, sometimes referred to as
appearing in Volume I. In this edition, the <a href='http://www.gutenberg.org/files/57376/57376-h/57376-h.htm#MAP'>map</a> appears
at the end of Volume III.</p>

<p class='c001'>Minor errors, attributable to the printer, have been corrected. Given
the history of the text, it was thought best to leave all orthography
as printed.</p>

<p class='c001'>Please see the transcriber’s <a href='#endnote'>note</a> at the end of this text
for details regarding the handling of any textual issues encountered
during its preparation.</p>

<div class='htmlonly'>

<p class='c001'>Any corrections are indicated using an <ins class='correction' title='original'>underline</ins>
highlight. Placing the cursor over the correction will produce the
original text in a small popup.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>BOOK IV—<em>Continued</em> <br /> RELIGIOUS ESTABLISHMENTS, FESTIVALS, <br /> AND CUSTOMS OF MEWĀR</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c011'>CHAPTER 19</h3>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Influence of the Priesthood.</h4>—In all ages the ascendancy of the
hierarchy is observable; it is a tribute paid to religion through
her organs. Could the lavish endowments and extensive immunities
of the various religious establishments in Rajasthan be
assumed as criteria of the morality of the inhabitants, we should
be authorized to assign them a high station in the scale of excellence.
But they more frequently prove the reverse of their
position; especially the territorial endowments, often the fruits
of a death-bed repentance,<a id='r4.19.1' /><a href='#f4.19.1' class='c013'><sup>[1]</sup></a> which, prompted by superstition or
fear, compounds for past crimes by posthumous profusion,
although vanity not rarely lends her powerful aid. There is
scarcely a State in Rajputana in which one-fifth of the soil is not
assigned for the support of the temples, their ministers, the
secular Brahmans, bards, and [508] genealogists. But the evil
was not always so extensive; the abuse is of modern growth.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Weighing of Princes against Gold.</h4>—An anecdote related of the
Rajas of Marwar and Amber, always rivals in war, love, and folly,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_590'>590</span>will illustrate the motives of these dismemberments. During the
annual pilgrimage to the sacred lake of Pushkar, it is the custom
for these lords of the earth to weigh their persons against all that
is rare, in gold, gems, and precious cloths; which are afterwards
distributed to the priests.<a id='r4.19.2' /><a href='#f4.19.2' class='c013'><sup>[2]</sup></a> The Amber chief had the advantage
of a full treasury and a fertile soil, to which his rival could oppose
a more extended sway over a braver race; but his country was
proverbially poor, and at Pushkar, the weight of the purse ranks
above the deeds of the sword. As these princes were suspended
in the scale, the Amber Raja, who was balanced against the more
costly material, indirectly taunted his brother-in-law on the
poverty of his offerings, who would gladly, like the Roman, have
made up the deficiency with his sword. But the Marwar prince
had a minister of tact, at whose suggestion he challenged his
rival (of Amber) to equal him in the magnitude of his gift to the
Brahmans. On the gage being accepted, the Rathor exclaimed,
“Perpetual charity (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>sasan</em></span>)<a id='r4.19.3' /><a href='#f4.19.3' class='c013'><sup>[3]</sup></a> of all the lands held by the Brahmans
in Marwar!” His unreflecting rival had commenced the
redemption of his pledge, when his minister stopped the
half-uttered vow, which would have impoverished the family
for ever; for there were ten Brahmans in Amber who followed
secular employments, cultivating or holding lands in usufruct,
to one in Marwar. Had these lords of the earth been left to their
misguided vanity, the fisc of each state would have been seriously
curtailed.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Grants to Brāhmans and Devotees.</h4>—The Brahmans, Sannyasis,
and Gosains are not behind those professional flatterers, the
Bards; and many a princely name would have been forgotten
but for the record of the gift of land. In Mewar, the lands in
<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>sasan</em></span>, or religious grants, amount in value to one-fifth of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_591'>591</span>revenue of the State, and the greater proportion of these has
arisen out of the prodigal mismanagement of the last century.
The dilapidated state of the country, on the general pacification
in <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1818, afforded a noble opportunity to redeem in part these
alienations, without the penalty of denunciation attached to the
resumer of sacred charities. But death, famine, and exile, which
had left but few of the grantees in a capacity to return and
reoccupy the lands, in vain coalesced to restore the fisc of Mewar.
The Rana dreaded a “sixty thousand [509] years’ residence in
hell,” and some of the finest land of his country is doomed to
remain unproductive. In this predicament is the township of
Menal,<a id='r4.19.4' /><a href='#f4.19.4' class='c013'><sup>[4]</sup></a> with 50,000 bighas (16,000 acres), which with the exception
of a nook where some few have established themselves,
claiming to be descendants of the original holders, are condemned
to sterility, owing to the agricultural proprietors and the rent-receiving
Brahmans being dead; and apathy united to superstition
admits their claims without inquiry.</div>

<p class='c001'>The antiquary, who has dipped into the records of the dark
period in European church history, can have ocular illustration
in Rajasthan of traditions which may in Europe appear questionable.
The vision of the Bishop of Orleans,<a id='r4.19.5' /><a href='#f4.19.5' class='c013'><sup>[5]</sup></a> who saw Charles
Martel in the depths of hell, undergoing the tortures of the damned,
for having stripped the churches of their possessions, “thereby
rendering himself guilty of the sins of all those who had endowed
them,” would receive implicit credence from every Hindu, whose
ecclesiastical economy might both yield and derive illustration
from a comparison, not only with that of Europe, but with the
more ancient Egyptian and Jewish systems, whose endowments,
as explained by Moses and Ezekiel, bear a strong analogy to his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_592'>592</span>own. The disposition of landed property in Egypt, as amongst
the ancient Hindus, was immemorially vested in the cultivator;
and it was only through Joseph’s ministry in the famine that
“the land became Pharaoh’s, as the Egyptians sold every man
his field.”<a id='r4.19.6' /><a href='#f4.19.6' class='c013'><sup>[6]</sup></a> And the coincidence is manifest even in the tax
imposed on them as occupants of their inheritance, being one-fifth
of the crops to the king, while the maximum rate among the
Hindus is a sixth.<a id='r4.19.7' /><a href='#f4.19.7' class='c013'><sup>[7]</sup></a> The Hindus also, in visitations such as that
which occasioned the dispossession of the ryots of Egypt, can
mortgage or sell their patrimony (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>bapota</em></span>). Joseph did not attempt
to infringe the privileges of the sacred order when the whole of
Egypt became crown-land, “except the lands of the priests,
which became not Pharaoh’s”; and these priests, according to
Diodorus, held for themselves and the sacrifices no less than
one-third of the lands of Egypt. But we learn from [510] Herodotus,
that Sesostris, who ruled after Joseph’s ministry, restored
the lands to the people, reserving the customary tax or tribute.<a id='r4.19.8' /><a href='#f4.19.8' class='c013'><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The prelates of the middle ages of Europe were often completely
feudal nobles, swearing fealty and paying homage as did
the lay lords.<a id='r4.19.9' /><a href='#f4.19.9' class='c013'><sup>[9]</sup></a> In Rajasthan, the sacerdotal caste not bound
to the altar may hold lands and perform the duties of vassalage:<a id='r4.19.10' /><a href='#f4.19.10' class='c013'><sup>[10]</sup></a>
but of late years, when land has been assigned to religious establishments,
no reservation has been made of fiscal rights, territorial
or commercial. This is, however, an innovation; since, formerly,
princes never granted, along with territorial assignments,
the prerogative of dispensing justice, of levying transit duties, or
exemption from personal service of the feudal tenant who held
on the land thus assigned. Well may Rajput heirs exclaim with
the grandson of Clovis, “our exchequer is impoverished, and our
riches are transferred to the clergy.”<a id='r4.19.11' /><a href='#f4.19.11' class='c013'><sup>[11]</sup></a> But Chilperic had the
courage to recall the grants of his predecessors, which, however,
the pious Gontram re-established. Many Gontrams could be
found, though but few Chilperics, in Rajasthan: we have, indeed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_593'>593</span>one in Jograj,<a id='r4.19.12' /><a href='#f4.19.12' class='c013'><sup>[12]</sup></a> the Rana’s ancestor, almost a contemporary of
the Merovingian king, who not only resumed all the lands of the
Brahmans, but put many of them to death, and expelled the
rest his dominions.<a id='r4.19.13' /><a href='#f4.19.13' class='c013'><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It may be doubted whether vanity and shame are not sufficient
in themselves to prevent a resumption of the lands of the Mangtas
or mendicants, as they style all those ‘who extend the palm,’
without the dreaded penalty, which operates very slightly on
the sub-vassal or cultivator, who, having no superfluity, defies
their anathemas when they attempt to wrest from him, by virtue
of the crown-grant, any of his long-established rights. By these,
the threat of impure transmigration is despised; and the Brahman
may spill his blood on the threshold of his dwelling or in
the field in dispute, which will be relinquished by the owner but
with his life. The Pat Rani, or chief queen, on the death of
Prince Amra, the heir-apparent, in 1818, bestowed a grant of
fifteen bighas of land, in one of the central districts, on a Brahman
who had assisted in the funeral rites of her son. With grant in
hand [511], he hastened to the Jat proprietor, and desired him
to make over to him the patch of land. The latter coolly replied
that he would give him all the prince had a right to, namely the
tax. The Brahman threatened to spill his own blood if he did
not obey the command, and gave himself a gash in a limb; but
the Jat was inflexible, and declared that he would not surrender
his patrimony (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>bapota</em></span>) even if he slew himself.<a id='r4.19.14' /><a href='#f4.19.14' class='c013'><sup>[14]</sup></a> In short, the</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_594'>594</span>ryot of Mewar would reply, even to his sovereign, if he demanded
his field, in the very words of Naboth to Ahab, king of Israel,
when he demanded the vineyard contiguous to the palace:
“The Lord forbid it me that I should give the inheritance of my
fathers unto thee.”</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Tithes, Temples.</h4>—But the tithes, and other small and legally
established rights of the hierarchy, are still religiously maintained.
The village temple and the village priest are always
objects of veneration to the industrious husbandman, on whom
superstition acts more powerfully than on the bold marauding
Rajput, who does not hesitate to demand salvamenta (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>rakhwali</em></span>)
from the lands of Kanhaiya or Eklinga. But the poor ryot of
the nineteenth century of Vikrama has the same fears as the
peasants of Charlemagne, who were made to believe that the
ears of corn found empty had been devoured by infernal spirits,
reported to have said they owed their feast to the non-payment
of tithes.<a id='r4.19.15' /><a href='#f4.19.15' class='c013'><sup>[15]</sup></a></div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Political Influence of Brāhmans.</h4>—The political influence of
the Brahmans is frequently exemplified in cases alike prejudicial
to the interests of society and the personal welfare of the sovereign.
The latter is often surrounded by lay-Brahmans as confidential
servants, in the capacities of butler, keeper of the wardrobe, or
seneschal,<a id='r4.19.16' /><a href='#f4.19.16' class='c013'><sup>[16]</sup></a> besides the Guru or domestic chaplain, who to the
duty of ghostly comforter sometimes joins that of [512] astrologer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_595'>595</span>and physician, in which case God help the prince!<a id='r4.19.17' /><a href='#f4.19.17' class='c013'><sup>[17]</sup></a> These
Gurus and Purohits, having the education of the children, acquire
immense influence, and are not backward in improving “the
greatness thrust upon them.” They are all continually importuning
their prince for grants of land for themselves and the
shrines they are attached to; and every chief, as well as every
influential domestic, takes advantage of ephemeral favour to
increase the endowments of his tutelary divinity. The Peshwas
of Satara are the most striking out of numerous examples.</div>

<p class='c001'>In the dark ages of Europe the monks are said to have prostituted
their knowledge of writing to the forging of charters in
their own favour: a practice not easily detected in the days of
ignorance.<a id='r4.19.18' /><a href='#f4.19.18' class='c013'><sup>[18]</sup></a> The Brahmans, in like manner, do not scruple to
employ this method of augmenting the wealth of their shrines;
and superstition and indolence combine to support the deception
<span class='pageno' id='Page_596'>596</span>There is not a doubt that the grand charter of Nathdwara was a
forgery, in which the prince’s butler was bribed to aid; and
report alleges that the Rana secretly favoured an artifice which
regard to opinion prevented him from overtly promulgating.
Although the copper-plate had been buried under ground, and
came out disguised with a coating of verdigris, there were marks
which proved the date of its execution to be false. I have seen
charters which, it has been gravely asserted, were granted by
Rama upwards of three thousand years ago! Such is the origin
assigned to one found in a well at the ancient Brahmpuri, in the
valley of the capital. If there be sceptics as to its validity, they
are silent ones; and this copper-plate of the brazen age [513] is
worth gold to the proprietor.<a id='r4.19.19' /><a href='#f4.19.19' class='c013'><sup>[19]</sup></a> A census<a id='r4.19.20' /><a href='#f4.19.20' class='c013'><sup>[20]</sup></a> of the three central
districts of Mewar discovered that more than twenty thousand
acres of these fertile lands, irrigated by the Berach and Banas
rivers, were distributed in isolated portions, of which the mendicant
castes had the chief share, and which proved fertile sources
of dispute to the husbandman and the officers of the revenue.
From the mass of title-deeds of every description by which these
lands were held, one deserves to be selected, on account of its
being pretended to have been written and bestowed on the
incumbent’s ancestor by the deity upwards of three centuries
ago, and which has been maintained as a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>bona-fide</em></span> grant of
Krishna<a id='r4.19.21' /><a href='#f4.19.21' class='c013'><sup>[21]</sup></a> ever since. By such credulity and apathy are the
Rajput States influenced: yet let the reader check any rising
feeling of contempt for Hindu legislation, and cast a retrospective
glance at the page of European church history, where he will
observe in the time of the most potent of our monarchs that the
clergy possessed one-half of the soil:<a id='r4.19.22' /><a href='#f4.19.22' class='c013'><sup>[22]</sup></a> and the chronicles of
France will show him Charlemagne on his death-bed, bequeathing
two-thirds of his domains to the church, deeming the remaining
third sufficient for the ambition of four sons. The same dread
of futurity, and the hope to expiate the sins of a life, at its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_597'>597</span>close, by gifts to the organs of religion, is the motive for these
unwise alienations, whether in Europe or in Asia. Some of these
establishments, and particularly that at Nathdwara, made a
proper use of their revenues in keeping up the Sada-Brat, or
perpetual charity, though it is chiefly distributed to religious
pilgrims: but among the many complaints made of the misapplication
of the funds, the diminution of this hospitable right
is one; while, at other shrines, the avarice of the priests is
observable in the coarseness of the food dressed for sacrifice and
offering.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Tithes levied by Brāhmans.</h4>—Besides the crown-grants to the
greater establishments, the Brahmans received petty tithes from
the agriculturist, and a small duty from the trader, as <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>mapa</em></span> or
metage, throughout every township, corresponding with the
scale of the village-chapel. An inscription found by the author
at the town of Palod,<a id='r4.19.23' /><a href='#f4.19.23' class='c013'><sup>[23]</sup></a> and dated nearly seven centuries back,
affords a good specimen of the claims of the village [514] priesthood.
The following are among the items. The <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>serana</em></span>, or a
<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>ser</em></span>, in every <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>maund</em></span>, being the fortieth part of the grain of the
<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>unalu</em></span>, or summer-harvest; the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>karpa</em></span>, or a bundle from every
sheaf of the autumnal crops, whether <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>makai</em></span> (Indian corn), <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>bajra</em></span>
or <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>juar</em></span> (maize) [millet], or the other grains peculiar to that
season.<a id='r4.19.24' /><a href='#f4.19.24' class='c013'><sup>[24]</sup></a></div>

<p class='c001'>They also derive a tithe from the oil-mill and sugar-mill, and
receive a <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>kansa</em></span> or platter of food on all rejoicings, as births,
marriages, etc., with <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>charai</em></span>, or the right of pasturage on the
village common; and where they have become possessed of
landed property they have <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>halma</em></span>, or unpaid labour in man and
beasts, and implements, for its culture: an exaction well known
in Europe as one of the detested <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>corvées</em></span> of the feudal system of
France,<a id='r4.19.25' /><a href='#f4.19.25' class='c013'><sup>[25]</sup></a> the abolition of which was the sole boon the English
husbandman obtained by the charter of Runymede. Both the
chieftain and the priest exact <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>halma</em></span> in Rajasthan; but in that
country it is mitigated, and abuse is prevented, by a sentiment
unknown to the feudal despot of the middle ages of Europe, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_598'>598</span>which, though difficult to define, acts imperceptibly, having its
source in accordance of belief, patriarchal manners, and clannish
attachments.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Privileges of Saivas and Jains.</h4>—I shall now briefly consider
the privileges of the Saivas and Jains—the orthodox and heterodox
sects of Mewar; and then proceed to those of Vishnu, whose
worship is the most prevalent in these countries, and which I am
inclined to regard as of more recent origin.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Worship of Siva.</h4>—Mahadeva, or Iswara, is the tutelary
divinity of the Rajputs in Mewar; and from the early annals of
the dynasty appears to have been, with his consort Isani, the sole
object of Guhilot adoration. Iswara is adored under the epithet
of Eklinga,<a id='r4.19.26' /><a href='#f4.19.26' class='c013'><sup>[26]</sup></a> and is either worshipped in his monolithic symbol,
or as Iswara Chaumukhi, the quadriform divinity, represented
by a bust with four faces. The sacred bull, Nandi, has his altar
attached to all the shrines of Iswara, as was that of Mneves or
Apis to those of the Egyptian Osiris. Nandi has occasionally
his separate shrines, and there is one in the valley of Udaipur
which has the reputation of being oracular as regards the seasons.
The bull was the steed of Iswara, and [515] carried him in battle;
he is often represented upon it, with his consort Isani, at full
speed. I will not stop to inquire whether the Grecian fable of
the rape of Europa<a id='r4.19.27' /><a href='#f4.19.27' class='c013'><sup>[27]</sup></a> by the tauriform Jupiter may not be derived,
with much more of their mythology, from the Hindu pantheon;
whether that pantheon was originally erected on the Indus, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_599'>599</span>the Ganges, or the more central scene of early civilization, the
banks of the Oxus. The bull was offered to Mithras by the
Persian, and opposed as it now appears to Hindu faith, he formerly
bled on the altars of the Sun-god, on which not only the Baldan,<a id='r4.19.28' /><a href='#f4.19.28' class='c013'><sup>[28]</sup></a>
‘offering of the bull,’ was made, but human sacrifices.<a id='r4.19.29' /><a href='#f4.19.29' class='c013'><sup>[29]</sup></a> We do
not learn that the Egyptian priesthood presented the kindred of
Apis to Osiris, but as they were not prohibited from eating beef,
they may have done so.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Temple of Eklinga.</h4>—The shrine of Eklinga is situated in
a defile about six [twelve] miles north of Udaipur. The hills
towering around it on all sides are of the primitive formation,
and their scarped summits are clustered with honeycombs.<a id='r4.19.30' /><a href='#f4.19.30' class='c013'><sup>[30]</sup></a>
There are abundant small springs of water, which keep verdant
numerous shrubs, the flowers of which are acceptable to the
deity; especially the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>kaner</em></span> or oleander, which grows in great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_600'>600</span>luxuriance on the Aravalli. Groves of bamboo and mango were
formerly common, according to tradition; but although it is
deemed sacrilege to thin the groves of Bal,<a id='r4.19.31' /><a href='#f4.19.31' class='c013'><sup>[31]</sup></a> the bamboo has been
nearly destroyed: there are, however, still many trees sacred to
the deity scattered around. It would be difficult to convey a
just [516] idea of a temple so complicated in its details. It is of
the form commonly styled pagoda, and, like all the ancient
temples of Siva, its <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>sikhara</em></span>, or pinnacle, is pyramidal. The
various orders of Hindu sacred architecture are distinguished by
the form of the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>sikhara</em></span>, which is the portion springing from and
surmounting the perpendicular walls of the body of the temple.
The <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>sikhara</em></span> of those of Siva is invariably pyramidal, and its
sides vary with the base, whether square or oblong. The apex
is crowned with an ornamental figure, as a sphinx, an urn, a
ball, or a lion, which is called the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>kalas</em></span>. When the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>sikhara</em></span> is
but the frustum of a pyramid, it is often surmounted by a row
of lions, as at Bijolia. The fane of Eklinga is of white marble
and of ample dimensions. Under an open-vaulted temple
supported by columns, and fronting the four-faced divinity, is
the brazen bull Nandi, of the natural size; it is cast, and of
excellent proportions. The figure is perfect, except where the
shot or hammer of an infidel invader has penetrated its hollow
flank in search of treasure. Within the quadrangle are miniature
shrines, containing some of the minor divinities.<a id='r4.19.32' /><a href='#f4.19.32' class='c013'><sup>[32]</sup></a> The high-priest
of Eklinga, like all his order, is doomed to celibacy, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_601'>601</span>the office is continued by adopted disciples. Of such spiritual
descents they calculate sixty-four since the Sage Harita, whose
benediction obtained for the Guhilot Rajput the sovereignty of
Chitor, when driven from Saurashtra by the Parthians.</div>

<p class='c001'>The priests of Eklinga are termed Gosain or Goswami, which
signifies ‘control over the senses’! The distinguishing mark
of the faith of Siva is the crescent on the forehead:<a id='r4.19.33' /><a href='#f4.19.33' class='c013'><sup>[33]</sup></a> the hair is
braided and forms a tiara round the head, and with its folds a
chaplet of the lotus-seed is often entwined. They smear the
body with ashes, and use garments dyed of an orange hue. They
bury their dead in a sitting [517] posture, and erect tumuli over
them, which are generally conical in form.<a id='r4.19.34' /><a href='#f4.19.34' class='c013'><sup>[34]</sup></a> It is not uncommon
for priestesses to officiate in the temple of Siva. There is a
numerous class of Gosains who have adopted celibacy, and who
yet follow secular employments both in commerce and arms.
The mercantile Gosains<a id='r4.19.35' /><a href='#f4.19.35' class='c013'><sup>[35]</sup></a> are amongst the richest individuals in
India, and there are several at Udaipur who enjoy high favour,
and who were found very useful when the Mahrattas demanded
a war-contribution, as their privileged character did not prevent
their being offered and taken as hostages for its payment. The
Gosains who profess arms, partake of the character of the knights
of St. John of Jerusalem. They live in monasteries scattered
over the country, possess lands, and beg, or serve for pay when
called upon. As defensive soldiers, they are good. Siva, their
patron, is the god of war, and like him they make great use of
intoxicating herbs, and even of spirituous liquors. In Mewar
they can always muster many hundreds of the Kanphara<a id='r4.19.36' /><a href='#f4.19.36' class='c013'><sup>[36]</sup></a> Jogi,
or ‘split-ear ascetics,’ so called from the habit of piercing the ear
and placing therein a ring of the conch-shell, which is their battle-trumpet.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_602'>602</span>Both Brahmans and Rajputs, and even <b>Gujars</b>, can
belong to this order, a particular account of whose internal
discipline and economy could not fail to be interesting. The
poet Chand gives an animated description of the body-guard of the
King of Kanauj, which was composed of these monastic warriors.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Priestly Functions of the Mewār Rānas.</h4>—The Ranas of Mewar,
as the diwans, or vicegerents of Siva, when they visit the temple
supersede the high priest in his duties, and perform the ceremonies,
which the reigning prince does with peculiar correctness and
grace.<a id='r4.19.37' /><a href='#f4.19.37' class='c013'><sup>[37]</sup></a></div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Privileges of Jains.</h4>—The shrine of Eklinga is endowed with
twenty-four large villages from the fisc, besides parcels of land
from the chieftains; but the privileges of the tutelary divinity
have been waning since Kanhaiya fixed his residence amongst
them; and as the priests of Apollo complained that the god
was driven from the sacred mount [518] Govardhana, in Vraj, by
the influence of those of Jupiter<a id='r4.19.38' /><a href='#f4.19.38' class='c013'><sup>[38]</sup></a> with Shah Jahan, the latter
may now lament that the day of retribution has arrived, when
propitiation to the Preserver is deemed more important than to
the Destroyer. This may arise from the personal character of
the high priests, who, from their vicinity to the court, can scarcely
avoid mingling in its intrigues, and thence lose in character:
even the Ranis do not hesitate to take mortgages on the estates
of Bholanath.<a id='r4.19.39' /><a href='#f4.19.39' class='c013'><sup>[39]</sup></a> We shall not further enlarge on the immunities
to Eklinga, or the forms in which they are conveyed, as these
will be fully discussed in the account of the shrine of Krishna;
but proceed to notice the privileges of the heterodox Jains—the
Vidyavan<a id='r4.19.40' /><a href='#f4.19.40' class='c013'><sup>[40]</sup></a> or Magi of Rajasthan. The numbers and power of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_603'>603</span>these sectarians are little known to Europeans, who take it for
granted that they are few and dispersed. To prove the extent
of their religious and political power, it will suffice to remark
that the pontiff of the Khadatara-gachchha,<a id='r4.19.41' /><a href='#f4.19.41' class='c013'><sup>[41]</sup></a> one of the many
branches of this faith, has 11,000 clerical disciples scattered over
India; that a single community, the Osi or Oswal,<a id='r4.19.42' /><a href='#f4.19.42' class='c013'><sup>[42]</sup></a> numbers
100,000 families; and that more than half [519] of the mercantile
wealth of India passes through the hands of the Jain laity.
Rajasthan and Saurashtra are the cradles of the Buddhist or
Jain faith, and three out of their five sacred mounts, namely,
Abu, Palitana,<a id='r4.19.43' /><a href='#f4.19.43' class='c013'><sup>[43]</sup></a> and Girnar, are in these countries. The officers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_604'>604</span>of the State and revenue are chiefly of the Jain laity, as are the
majority of the bankers, from Lahore to the ocean. The chief
magistrate and assessors of justice, in Udaipur and most of the
towns of Rajasthan, are of this sect; and as their voluntary
duties are confined to civil cases, they are as competent in these
as they are the reverse in criminal cases, from their tenets forbidding
the shedding of blood. To this leading feature in their
religion they owe their political debasement: for Kumarpal, the
last king of Anhilwara of the Jain faith, would not march his
armies in the rains, from the unavoidable sacrifice of animal life
that must have ensued. The strict Jain does not even maintain
a lamp during that season, lest it should attract moths to their
destruction.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Absence of Intolerance.</h4>—The period of sectarian intolerance
is now past; and as far as my observation goes, the ministers of
Vishnu, Siva, and Buddha view each other without malignity;
which feeling never appears to have influenced the laity of either
sect, who are indiscriminately respectful to the ministers of all
religions, whatever be their tenets. It is sufficient that their
office is one of sanctity, and that they are ministers of the Divinity,
who, they say, excludes the homage of none, in whatever tongue
or whatever manner he is sought; and with this spirit of entire
toleration, the devout missionary, or Mulla, would in no country
meet more security or hospitable courtesy than among the
Rajputs. They must, however, adopt the toleration they would
find practised towards themselves, and not exclude, as some of
them do, the races of Surya and Chandra from divine mercy, who,
with less arrogance, and more reliance on the compassionate
nature of the Creator, say, he has established a variety of paths
by which the good may attain beatitude.</div>

<p class='c001'>Mewar has, from the most remote period, afforded a refuge to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_605'>605</span>the followers of the Jain faith, which was the religion of Valabhi,
the first capital of the Rana’s ancestors, and many monuments
attest the support this family has granted to its [520] professors
in all the vicissitudes of their fortunes. One of the best preserved
monumental remains in India is a column most elaborately
sculptured, full seventy feet in height, dedicated to Parsvanath,
in Chitor.<a id='r4.19.44' /><a href='#f4.19.44' class='c013'><sup>[44]</sup></a> The noblest remains of sacred architecture, not in
Mewar only, but throughout Western India, are Buddhist or
Jain:<a id='r4.19.45' /><a href='#f4.19.45' class='c013'><sup>[45]</sup></a> and the many ancient cities where this religion was
fostered, have inscriptions which evince their prosperity in these
countries, with whose history their own is interwoven. In fine,
the necrological records of the Jains bear witness to their having
occupied a distinguished place in Rajput society; and the
privileges they still enjoy, prove that they are not overlooked.
It is not my intention to say more on the past or present history
of these sectarians, than may be necessary to show the footing
on which their establishments are placed; to which end little is
required beyond copies of a few simple warrants and ordinances
in their favour.<a id='r4.19.46' /><a href='#f4.19.46' class='c013'><sup>[46]</sup></a> Hereafter I may endeavour to add something
to the knowledge already possessed of these deists of Rajasthan,
whose singular communities contain mines of knowledge hitherto
inaccessible to Europeans. The libraries of Jaisalmer in the
desert, of Anhilwara, the cradle of their faith, of Cambay, and
other places of minor importance, consist of thousands of volumes.
These are under the control, not of the priests alone, but of
communities of the most wealthy and respectable amongst the
laity, and are preserved in the crypts of their temples, which
precaution ensured their preservation, as well as that of the
statues of their deified teachers, when the temples themselves
were destroyed by the Muhammadan invaders, who paid more
deference to the images of Buddha than those of Siva or Vishnu.
The preservation of the former may be owing to the natural
formation of their statues; for while many of Adinath, of Nemi,
and of Parsva have escaped the hammer, there is scarcely an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_606'>606</span>Apollo or a Venus, of any antiquity, entire, from Lahore to
Rameswaram. The two arms of these theists sufficed for their
protection; while the statues of the polytheists have met with
no mercy.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Grant of Rāna Rāj Singh.</h4>—No. V.<a id='r4.19.47' /><a href='#f4.19.47' class='c013'><sup>[47]</sup></a> is the translation of a
grant by the celebrated Rana Raj Singh, the gallant and successful
opponent of Aurangzeb in many a battle. It is at once of a
general and special nature, containing a confirmation of the old
privileges of the sect, and a mark of favour to a priest of some
distinction, called Mana. It is well known [521] that the first
law of the Jains, like that of the ancient Athenian lawgiver
Triptolemus, is, “Thou shalt not kill,” a precept applicable to
every sentient thing. The first clause of this edict, in conformity
thereto, prohibits all innovation upon this cherished principle;
while the second declares that even the life which is forfeited to
the laws is immortal (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>amara</em></span>) if the victim but passes near their
abodes. The third article defines the extent of <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>saran</em></span>, or sanctuary,
the dearest privilege of the races of these regions. The
fourth article sanctions the tithes, both on agricultural and
commercial produce; and makes no distinction between the
Jain priests and those of Siva and Vishnu in this source of income,
which will be more fully detailed in the account of Nathdwara.
The fifth article is the particular gift to the priest; and the whole
closes with the usual anathema against such as may infringe the
ordinance.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Jain Retreat.</h4>—The edicts Nos. VI. and VII.,<a id='r4.19.48' /><a href='#f4.19.48' class='c013'><sup>[48]</sup></a> engraved
on pillars of stone in the towns of Rasmi and Bakrol, further
illustrate the scrupulous observances of the Rana’s house towards
the Jains; where, in compliance with their peculiar doctrine,
the oil-mill and the potter’s wheel suspend their revolutions for
the four months in the year when insects most abound.<a id='r4.19.49' /><a href='#f4.19.49' class='c013'><sup>[49]</sup></a> Many
others of a similar character could be furnished, but these remarks
may be concluded with an instance of the influence of the Jains
on Rajput society, which passed immediately under the Author’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_607'>607</span>eye. In the midst of a sacrifice to the god of war, when the
victims were rapidly falling by the scimitar, a request preferred
by one of them for the life of a goat or a buffalo on the point of
immolation, met instant compliance, and the animal, become
<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>amara</em></span> or immortal, with a garland thrown round his neck, was
led off in triumph from the blood-stained spot.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Nāthdwāra.</h4>—This is the most celebrated of the fanes of the
Hindu Apollo. Its etymology is ‘the portal (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>dwara</em></span>) of the god’
(<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>nath</em></span>), of the same import as his more ancient shrine of Dwarka<a id='r4.19.50' /><a href='#f4.19.50' class='c013'><sup>[50]</sup></a>
at the ‘world’s end.’ Nathdwara is twenty-two [thirty] miles
N.N.E. of Udaipur, on the right bank of the Banas. Although
the principal resort of the followers of Vishnu, it has nothing
very remarkable in its structure or situation. It owes its celebrity
entirely to the image of Krishna, said to [522] be the same that
has been worshipped at Mathura ever since his deification, between
eleven and twelve hundred years before Christ.<a id='r4.19.51' /><a href='#f4.19.51' class='c013'><sup>[51]</sup></a> As
containing the representative of the mildest of the gods of Hind,
Nathdwara is one of the most frequented places of pilgrimage,
though it must want that attraction to the classical Hindu which
the caves of Gaya, the shores of the distant Dwarka, or the
pastoral Vraj,<a id='r4.19.52' /><a href='#f4.19.52' class='c013'><sup>[52]</sup></a> the place of the nativity of Krishna, present to
his imagination; for though the groves of Vindra,<a id='r4.19.53' /><a href='#f4.19.53' class='c013'><sup>[53]</sup></a> in which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_608'>608</span>Kanhaiya disported with the Gopis, no longer resound to the
echoes of his flute; though the waters of the Yamuna<a id='r4.19.54' /><a href='#f4.19.54' class='c013'><sup>[54]</sup></a> are daily
polluted with the blood of the sacred kine, still it is the holy land
of the pilgrim, the sacred Jordan of his fancy, on whose banks
he may sit and weep, as did the banished Israelite of old, the
glories of Mathura, his Jerusalem!</div>

<p class='c001'>It was in the reign of Aurangzeb that the pastoral divinity was
exiled from Vraj, that classic soil which, during a period of two
thousand eight hundred years, had been the sanctuary of his
worshippers. He had been compelled to occasional flights
during the visitations of Mahmud and the first dynasties of Afghan
invaders; though the more tolerant of the Mogul kings not only
reinstated him, but were suspected of dividing their faith between
Kanhaiya and the prophet. Akbar was an enthusiast in the
mystic poetry of Jayadeva, which paints in glowing colours the
loves of Kanhaiya and Radha, in which lovely personification
the refined Hindu abjures all sensual interpretation, asserting
its character of pure spiritual love.<a id='r4.19.55' /><a href='#f4.19.55' class='c013'><sup>[55]</sup></a></p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Mughals and Krishna Worship.</h4>—Jahangir, by birth half
a Rajput, was equally indulgent to the worship of Kanhaiya:
but Shah Jahan, also the son of a Rajput princess, inclined to
the [523] doctrines of Siva, in which he was initiated by Siddhrup
the Sannyasi. Sectarian animosity is more virulent than faiths
totally dissimilar. Here we see Hindu depressing Hindu: the
followers of Siva oppressing those of Kanhaiya; the priests of
Jupiter driving the pastoral Apollo from the Parnassus of Vraj.
At the intercession, however, of a princess of Udaipur, he was
replaced on his altar, where he remained till Aurangzeb became
emperor of the Moguls. In such detestation did the Hindus hold
<span class='pageno' id='Page_609'>609</span>this intolerant king, that in like manner as they supposed the
beneficent Akbar to be the devout Mukund in a former birth,
so they make the tyrant’s body enclose the soul of Kalyavana
the foe of Krishna, ere his apotheosis, from whom he fled to
Dwarka, and thence acquired the name of Ranchhor.<a id='r4.19.56' /><a href='#f4.19.56' class='c013'><sup>[56]</sup></a></div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Image of Krishna removed to Mewār. Founding of
Nāthdwāra.</h4>—When Aurangzeb proscribed Kanhaiya, and
rendered his shrines impure throughout Vraj, Rana Raj Singh
“offered the heads of one hundred thousand Rajputs for his
service,” and the god was conducted by the route of Kotah and
Rampura to Mewar. An omen decided the spot of his future
residence. As he journeyed to gain the capital of the Sesodias
the chariot-wheel sunk deep into the earth and defied extrication;
upon which the Saguni (augur) interpreted the pleasure of the
god, that he desired to dwell there. This circumstance occurred
at an inconsiderable village called Siarh, in the fief of Delwara,
one of the sixteen nobles of Mewar. Rejoiced at this decided
manifestation of favour, the chief hastened to make a perpetual
gift of the village and its lands, which was speedily confirmed by
the patent of the Rana.<a id='r4.19.57' /><a href='#f4.19.57' class='c013'><sup>[57]</sup></a> Nathji (<em>the</em> god) was removed from
his car, and in due time a temple was erected for his reception,
when the hamlet of Siarh became the town of Nathdwara, which
now contains many thousand inhabitants of all denominations,
who, reposing under the especial protection of the god, are exempt
from every mortal tribunal. The site is not uninteresting, nor
devoid of the means of defence. To the east it is shut in by a
cluster of hills, and to the westward flows the Banas, which nearly
bathes the extreme points of the hills. Within these bounds is
the sanctuary (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>saran</em></span>) of Kanhaiya, where the criminal is free from
pursuit; nor dare the rod of justice appear on the mount, or the
foot of the pursuer pass the stream; neither within it can blood
be spilt, for the pastoral Kanhaiya delights not in offerings of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_610'>610</span>this kind [524].<a id='r4.19.58' /><a href='#f4.19.58' class='c013'><sup>[58]</sup></a> The territory contains within its precincts
abundant space for the town, the temple, and the establishments
of the priests, as well as for the numerous resident worshippers,
and the constant influx of votaries from the most distant regions,</div>

of tamarind, pipal, and semal,<a id='r4.19.59' /><a href='#f4.19.59' class='c013'><sup>[59]</sup></a> where they listen to the mystic
hymns of Jayadeva. Here those whom ambition has cloyed,
superstition unsettled, satiety disgusted, commerce ruined, or
crime disquieted, may be found as ascetic attendants on the
mildest of the gods of India. Determined upon renouncing the
world, they first renounce the ties that bind them to it, whether
family, friends, or fortune, and placing their wealth at the disposal
of the deity, stipulate only for a portion of the food dressed for
him, and to be permitted to prostrate themselves before him till
their allotted time is expired. Here no blood-stained sacrifice
scares the timid devotee; no austerities terrify, or tedious ceremonies
fatigue him; he is taught to cherish the hope that he has
only to ask for mercy in order to obtain it; and to believe that
the compassionate deity who guarded the lapwing’s nest<a id='r4.19.60' /><a href='#f4.19.60' class='c013'><sup>[60]</sup></a> in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_611'>611</span>midst of myriads of combatants, who gave beatitude to the
courtesan<a id='r4.19.61' /><a href='#f4.19.61' class='c013'><sup>[61]</sup></a> who as the wall crushed her pronounced the name of
‘Rama,’ will not withhold it from him who has quitted the
world and its allurements that he may live only in his presence,
be fed by the food prepared for himself, and yield up his last sigh
invoking the name of Hari. There [525] have been two hundred
individuals at a time, many of whom, stipulating merely for food,
raiment, and funeral rites, have abandoned all to pass their days
in devotion at the shrine: men of every condition, Rajput
merchant, and mechanic; and where sincerity of devotion is the
sole expiation, and gifts outweigh penance, they must feel the
road smooth to the haven of hope.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Benefactions to Nāthdwāra.</h4>—The dead stock of Krishna’s
shrine is augmented chiefly by those who hold life “unstable as
the dew-drop on the lotus”; and who are happy to barter “the
wealth of Ormuz and of Ind” for the intercessional prayers of the
high priest, and his passport to Haripur, the heaven of Hari.
From the banks of the Indus to the mouths of the Ganges, from
the coasts of the Peninsula to the shores of the Red Sea, the gifts
of gratitude or of fear are lavishly poured in; and though the
unsettled aspect of the last half-century curtailed the transmission
of the more bulky but least valuable benefactions, it less affected
the bills of exchange from the successful sons of commerce, or
the legacies of the dead. The safe arrival of a galleon from
Sofala or Arabia produced as much to the shrine as to the insurance
office, for Kanhaiya is the Saint Nicholas of the Hindu
navigator, as was Apollo to the Grecian and Celtic sailors, who
purchased the charmed arrows of the god to calm the troubled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_612'>612</span>sea.<a id='r4.19.62' /><a href='#f4.19.62' class='c013'><sup>[62]</sup></a> A storm accordingly yields in proportion to its violence,
or to the nerve of the owner of the vessel. The appearance of a
long-denied heir might deprive him of half his patrimony, and
force him to lament his parent’s distrust in natural causes; while
the accidental mistake of touching forbidden food on particular
fasts requires expiation, not by flagellation or seclusion, but by
the penance of the purse.</div>

<p class='c001'>There is no donation too great or too trifling for the acceptance
of Krishna, from the baronial estate to a patch of meadowland;
from the gemmed coronet to adorn his image, to the widow’s
mite; nor, as before observed, is there a principality [526] in
India which does not diminish its fisc to add to his revenues.
What effect the milder rites of the shepherd-god have produced
on the adorers of Siva we know not, but assuredly Eklinga, the
tutelary divinity of Mewar, has to complain of being defrauded
of half his dues since Kanhaiya transferred his abode from the
Yamuna to the Banas; for the revenues assigned to Kanhaiya,
who under the epithet of ‘Yellow mantle’<a id='r4.19.63' /><a href='#f4.19.63' class='c013'><sup>[63]</sup></a> has a distinguished
niche in the domestic chapel of the Rana, far exceed those of the
Avenger. The grants or patents of Hindupati,<a id='r4.19.64' /><a href='#f4.19.64' class='c013'><sup>[64]</sup></a> defining the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_613'>613</span>privileges and immunities of the shrine, are curious documents.<a id='r4.19.65' /><a href='#f4.19.65' class='c013'><sup>[65]</sup></a></p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Rights of Sanctuary.</h4>—The extension of the sanctuary beyond
the vicinage of the shrine became a subject of much animadversion;
and in delegating judicial authority over the whole of the
villages in the grant to the priests, the Rana committed the
temporal welfare of his subjects to a class of men not apt to be
lenient in the collection of their dues, which not unfrequently led
to bloodshed. In alienating the other royalties, especially the
transit duties, he was censured even by the zealots. Yet, however
important such concessions, they were of subordinate value
to the rights of sanctuary, which were extended to the whole of
the towns in the grant, thereby multiplying the places of refuge
for crime, already too numerous.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Violation of Sanctuary.</h4>—In all ages and countries the rights
of sanctuary have been admitted, and however they may be
abused, their institution sprung from humane motives. To
check the impulse of revenge and to shelter the weak from oppression
are noble objects, and the surest test of a nation’s independence
is the extent to which they are carried. From the remotest
times <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>saran</em></span> has been the most valued privilege of the Rajputs,
the lowest of whom deems his house a refuge against the most
powerful. But we merely propose to discuss the sanctuary of
holy places, and more immediately that of the shrine of Kanhaiya.
When Moses, after the Exodus, made a division of the lands of
Canaan amongst the Israelites, and appointed “six cities to be
the refuge of him who had slain unwittingly, from the avenger
of blood,”<a id='r4.19.66' /><a href='#f4.19.66' class='c013'><sup>[66]</sup></a> the intention was not to afford facilities for eluding
justice, but to check the hasty impulse of revenge; for the slayer
was only to be protected “until he stood before the congregation
for judgment, or until the death of the high-priest” [527],
which event appears to have been considered as the termination
of revenge.<a id='r4.19.67' /><a href='#f4.19.67' class='c013'><sup>[67]</sup></a> The infraction of political sanctuary (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>saran torna</em></span>)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_614'>614</span>often gives rise to the most inveterate feuds; and its abuse by
the priests is highly prejudicial to society. Moses appointed
but six cities of refuge to the whole Levite tribe; but the Rana
has assigned more to one shrine than the entire possessions of
that branch of the Israelites who had but forty-two cities, while
Kanhaiya has forty-six.<a id='r4.19.68' /><a href='#f4.19.68' class='c013'><sup>[68]</sup></a> The motive of sanctuary in Rajasthan
may have been originally the same as that of the divine legislator;
but the privilege has been abused, and the most notorious criminals
deem the temple their best safeguard. Yet some princes have
been found hardy enough to violate, though indirectly, the
sacred <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>saran</em></span>. Zalim Singh of Kotah, a zealot in all the observances
of religion, had the boldness to draw the line when selfish
priestcraft interfered with his police; and though he would not
demand the culprit, or sacrilegiously drag him from the altar,
he has forced him thence by prohibiting the admission of food,
and threatening to build up the door of the temple. It was
thus the Greeks evaded the laws, and compelled the criminal’s
surrender by kindling fires around the sanctuary.<a id='r4.19.69' /><a href='#f4.19.69' class='c013'><sup>[69]</sup></a> The towns
of Kanhaiya did not often abuse their privilege; but the Author
once had to interpose, where a priest of Eklinga gave asylum
to a felon who had committed murder within the bounds of his
domain of Pahona. As this town, of eight thousand rupees
annual revenue belonging to the fisc, had been gained by a forged
charter, the Author was glad to seize on the occasion to recommend
its resumption, though he thereby incurred the penalty for seizing
church land, namely “sixty thousand years in hell.” The unusual
occurrence created a sensation, but it was so indisputably
just that not a voice was raised in opposition.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Endowments of Nāthdwāra.</h4>—Let us revert to the endowments
of Nathdwara. Herodotus<a id='r4.19.70' /><a href='#f4.19.70' class='c013'><sup>[70]</sup></a> furnishes a powerful instance of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_615'>615</span>the estimation in which sacred offerings were held by the nations
of antiquity. He observes that these were transmitted from the
remotest nations of Scythia to Delos in Greece; a range far less
extensive than the offerings to the [528] Dewal of Apollo in
Mewar. The spices of the isles of the Indian archipelago; the
balmy spoils of Araby the blest; the nard or frankincense of
Tartary; the raisins and pistachios of Persia; every variety of
saccharine preparation, from the shakkarkhand (sugar-candy)
of the celestial empire, with which the god sweetens his evening
repast, to the more common sort which enters into the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>peras</em></span>
of Mathura, the food of his infancy;<a id='r4.19.71' /><a href='#f4.19.71' class='c013'><sup>[71]</sup></a> the shawls of Kashmir,

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>all contribute to enrich the shrine of Nathdwara. But it is with
the votaries of the maritime provinces of India that he has most
reason to be satisfied; in the commercial cities of Surat, Cambay,
Muskat-mandavi, etc., etc., where the Mukhyas, or comptrollers
deputed by the high priest, reside, to collect the benefactions,
and transmit them as occasion requires. A deputy resides on
the part of the high priest at Multan, who invests the distant
worshippers with the initiative cordon and necklace. Even from
Samarkand the pilgrims repair with their offerings; and a sum,
seldom less than ten thousand rupees, is annually transmitted
by the votaries from the Arabian ports of Muscat, Mocha, and
Jiddah; which contribution is probably augmented not only
by the votaries who dwell at the mouths of the Volga<a id='r4.19.72' /><a href='#f4.19.72' class='c013'><sup>[72]</sup></a> [529],
<span class='pageno' id='Page_616'>616</span>but by the Samoyede<a id='r4.19.73' /><a href='#f4.19.73' class='c013'><sup>[73]</sup></a> of Siberia. There is not a petty retailer
professing the Vishnu creed who does not carry a tithe of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_617'>617</span>trade to the stores: and thus caravans of thirty and forty cars,
double-yoked, pass twice or thrice annually by the upper road
to Nathdwara. These pious bounties are not allowed to moulder
in the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>bhandars</em></span>: the apparel is distributed with a liberal hand
as the gift of the deity to those who evince their devotion; and
the edibles enter daily into the various food prepared at the
shrine.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Food offered to Deities.</h4>—It has been remarked by the celebrated
Goguet<a id='r4.19.74' /><a href='#f4.19.74' class='c013'><sup>[74]</sup></a> that the custom of offering food to the object of divine
homage had its origin in a principle of gratitude, the repast being
deemed hallowed by presenting the first portion to him who
gave it, since the devotee was unable to conceive aught more
acceptable than that whereby life is sustained. From the earliest
period such offerings have been tendered; and in the burnt-offering
(<em>hom</em>) of Abel, of the firstling of the flock, and the first
portion of the repast presented by the Rajput to Annadeva<a id='r4.19.75' /><a href='#f4.19.75' class='c013'><sup>[75]</sup></a>
‘the nourisher,’ the motive is the same. But the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>parsad</em></span> (such
is the denomination of the food sacred to Kanhaiya) is deemed
unlucky, if not unholy; a prejudice arising from the heterogeneous
sources whence it is supplied—often from bequests of the dead.
The Mukhyas [530] of the temple accordingly carry the sacred
food to wheresoever the votaries dwell, which proves an irresistible
stimulus to backward zeal, and produces an ample return. At
<span class='pageno' id='Page_618'>618</span>the same time are transmitted, as from the god, dresses of honour
corresponding in material and value with the rank of the receiver:
a diadem, or fillet of satin and gold, embroidered; a <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>dagla</em></span>, or
quilted coat of gold or silver brocade for the cold weather; a
scarf of blue and gold; or if to one who prizes the gift less for its
intrinsic worth than as a mark of special favour, a fragment of
the garland worn on some festival by the god; or a simple necklace,
by which he is inaugurated amongst the elect.<a id='r4.19.76' /><a href='#f4.19.76' class='c013'><sup>[76]</sup></a></div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Lands dedicated to the Shrine.</h4>—It has been mentioned that
the lands of Mewar appropriated to the shrine are equal in value
to a baronial appanage, and, as before observed, there is not a
principality in India which does not assign a portion of its domain
or revenue to this object. The Hara princes of Kotah and Bundi
are almost exclusive worshippers of Kanhaiya, and the regent
Zalim Singh is devoted to the maintenance of the dignity of the
establishment. Everything at Kotah appertains to Kanhaiya.
The prince has but the usufruct of the palace, for which £12,000
are annually transmitted to the shrine. The grand lake east
of the town, with all its finny tenants, is under his especial protection;<a id='r4.19.77' /><a href='#f4.19.77' class='c013'><sup>[77]</sup></a>
and the extensive suburb adjoining, with its rents,
lands, and transit duties, all belong to the god. Zalim Singh

<span class='pageno' id='Page_619'>619</span>given to Kanhaiya in that State; and the Raja of Sheopur,<a id='r4.19.79' /><a href='#f4.19.79' class='c013'><sup>[79]</sup></a>

was the name of this prince) almost lived in the temple, and used
to dance before the statue. Had he upheld the rights of him
who wields [531] the trident, the tutelary deity of his capital,
Sivapur, instead of the unwarlike divinity whose unpropitious
title of Ranchhor should never be borne by the martial Rajput,
his fall would have been more dignified, though it could not have
been retarded when the overwhelming torrent of the Mahrattas

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Grants to the High Priest.</h4>—A distinction is made between
the grants to the temple and those for the personal use of the
pontiff, who at least affects never to apply any portion of the
former to his own use, and he can scarcely have occasion to do
so; but when from the stores of Apollo could be purchased the
spices of the isles, the fruits of Persia, and the brocades of Gujarat,
we may indulge our scepticism in questioning this forbearance:
but the abuse has been rectified, and traffic banished from the
temple. The personal grant (Appendix, No. <a href='#a4.20.11'>XI</a>.) to the high
priest ought alone to have sufficed for his household expenditure,
being twenty thousand rupees per annum, equal to £10,000 in
Europe. But the ten thousand towns of Mewar, from each of
which he levied a crown, now exist only in the old rent-roll, and
the heralds of Apollo would in vain attempt to collect their tribute
from two thousand villages.</div>

<p class='c001'>The Appendix, No. <a href='#a4.20.12'>XII</a>., being a grant of privileges to a minor
shrine of Kanhaiya, in his character of Muralidhar or ‘flute-player,’

and will afford a good idea of the nature of these revenues.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Effects of Krishna-worship on the Rājputs.</h4>—The predominance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_620'>620</span>of the mild doctrines of Kanhaiya over the dark rites of Siva,
is doubtless beneficial to Rajput society. Were the prevention
of female immolation the sole good resulting from their prevalence,
that alone would conciliate our partiality; a real worshipper
of Vishnu should forbid his wife following him to the pyre, as
did recently the Bundi prince. In fact, their tenderness to
animal life is carried to nearly as great an excess as with the
Jains, who shed no blood. Celibacy is not imposed upon the
priests of Kanhaiya, as upon those of Siva: on the contrary,
they are enjoined to marry, and the priestly office is hereditary
by descent. Their wives do not burn, but are committed, like
themselves, to the earth. They inculcate tenderness towards
all beings; though whether this feeling influences the mass, must
depend on the soil which receives the seed, for the outward
ceremonies of religion cost far less effort than the practice or
essentials. I have often [532] smiled at the incessant aspirations
of the Macchiavelli of Rajasthan, Zalim Singh, who, while he
ejaculated the name of the god as he told his beads, was inwardly
absorbed by mundane affairs; and when one word would have
prevented a civil war, and saved his reputation from the stain of
disloyalty to his prince, he was, to use his own words, “at fourscore
years and upwards, laying the foundation for another
century of life.” And thus it is with the prince of Marwar, who
esteems the life of a man or a goat of equal value when prompted
by revenge to take it. Hope may silence the reproaches of conscience,
and gifts and ceremonies may be deemed atonement for
a deviation from the first principle of their religion—a benevolence
which should comprehend every animated thing. But fortunately
the princely worshippers of Kanhaiya are few in number: it
is to the sons of commerce we must look for the effects of these
doctrines; and it is my pride and duty to declare that I have
known men of both sects, Vaishnava and Jain, whose integrity
was spotless, and whose philanthropy was unbounded.</div>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r4.19.17'>17</a>. Manu, in his rules on government, commands the king to impart his
momentous counsel and entrust all transactions to a learned and distinguished
Brahman (<cite>Laws</cite>, vii. 58). There is no being more aristocratic in his ideas
than the secular Brahman or priest, who deems the bare name a passport to
respect. The Kulin Brahman of Bengal piques himself upon this title of
nobility granted by the last Hindu king of Kanauj (whence they migrated
to Bengal), and in virtue of which his alliance in matrimony is courted.
But although Manu has imposed obligations towards the Brahman little
short of adoration, these are limited to the “learned in the Vedas”: he
classes the unlearned Brahman with “an elephant made of wood, or an antelope
of leather”; nullities, save in name. And he adds further, that “as
liberality to a fool is useless, so is a Brahman useless if he read not the holy
texts”: comparing the person who gives to such an one, to a husbandman
“who, sowing seed in a barren soil, reaps no gain”; so the Brahman “obtains
no reward in heaven.” These sentiments are repeated in numerous texts,
holding out the most powerful inducements to the sacerdotal class to cultivate
their minds, since their power consists solely in their wisdom. For
such, there are no privileges too extensive, no homage too great. “A
king, even though dying with want, must not receive any tax from a Brahman
learned in the Vedas.” His person is sacred. “Never shall the king
slay a Brahman, though convicted of all possible crimes,” is a premium at
least to unbounded insolence, and unfits them for members of society, more
especially for soldiers; banishment, with person and property untouched,
is the declared punishment for even the most heinous crimes. “A Brahman
may seize without hesitation, if he be distressed for a subsistence, the goods
of his Sudra slave.” But the following text is the climax: “What prince
could gain wealth by oppressing these [Brahmans], who, if angry, could
frame other worlds, and regents of worlds, and could give birth to new gods
and mortals?” (Manu, <cite>Laws</cite>, ii. iii. vii. viii. ix.).</p>

In March 1818 I again visited the shrine, on my way to Udaipur,

the family from oppression, and to labour for its prosperity. While standing
without the sanctuary, looking at the quadriform divinity, and musing
on the changes of the intervening twelve years, my meditations were broken

Baba Adam, ‘Father Adam,’ as he termed the phallic emblem. I excused

disputation (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>badha</em></span>) at that capital in the eleventh century. The celebrated

descendant honoured Udaipur with his presence in his visit to his dioceses

This pontiff was a man of extensive learning and of estimable character.
He was versed in all the ancient inscriptions, to which no key now exists,
and deciphered one for me which had been long unintelligible. His travelling
library was of considerable extent, though chiefly composed of works
relating to the ceremonies of his religion: it was in the charge of two of his
disciples remarkable for talent, and who, like himself, were perfectly acquainted
with all these ancient characters. The pontiff kindly permitted
my Yati to bring for my inspection some of the letters of invitation written
by his flocks in the desert. These were rolls, some of them several feet in
length, containing pictured delineations of their wishes. One from Bikaner
represented that city, in one division of which was the school or college of
the Jains, where the Yatis were all portrayed at their various studies. In
another part, a procession of them was quitting the southern gate of the
city, the head of which was in the act of delivering a scroll to a messenger,
while the pontiff was seen with his cortège advancing in the distance. To
show the respect in which these high priests of the Jains are held, the princes
of Rajputana invariably advance outside the walls of their capital to receive
and conduct them to it—a mark of respect paid only to princes. On the
occasion of the high priest of the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>Khadataras</em></span> passing through Udaipur, as

appealing to sympathy. The allusion here is to the lapwing scared from

when the compassionate Krishna, taking from an elephant’s neck a war-bell
(<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>viraghanta</em></span>), covered the nest, in order to protect it. When the majority
of the feudal nobles of Marwar became self-exiled, to avoid the almost
demoniac fury of their sovereign, since his alliance with the British Government,
Anar Singh, the chief of Ahor, a fine specimen of the Rathor Rajput,
brave, intelligent, and amiable, was one day lamenting, that while all India
was enjoying tranquillity under the shield of Britain, they alone were
suffering from the caprice of a tyrant; concluding a powerful appeal to
my personal interposition with the foregoing allegory, and observing on
the beauty of the office of mediator: “You are all-powerful,” added he,
“and we may be of little account in the grand scale of affairs; but Krishna
condescended to protect even the lapwing’s egg in the midst of battle.”
This brave man knew my anxiety to make their peace with their sovereign,
and being acquainted with the allegory, I replied with some fervour, in
the same strain, “Would to God, Thakur Sahib, I had the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>viraghanta</em></span> to
protect you.” The effect was instantaneous, and the eye of this manly
chieftain, who had often fearlessly encountered the foe in battle, filled
with tears as, holding out his hand, he said, “At least you listen to our
griefs, and speak the language of friendship. Say but the word, and you
may command the services of twenty thousand Rathors.” There is,
indeed, no human being more susceptible of excitement, and, under it, of

Rajput.</p>

Gaul were visited by the Phoenicians.”—“A college of Druidical priestesses

<p class='c001'><a href='#r4.19.72'>72</a>. Pallas gives an admirable and evidently faithful account of the worship
of Krishna and other Hindu divinities in the city of Astrakhan, where a
Hindu mercantile colony is established. They are termed Multani, from
the place whence they migrated—Multan, near the Indus. This class of
merchants of the Hindu faith is disseminated over all the countries, from
the Indus to the Caspian: and it would have been interesting had the
professor given us any account of their period of settlement on the western
shore of the Caspian Sea. In costume and feature, as represented in the
plate given by that author, they have nothing to denote their origin; though
their divinities might be seated on any altar on the Ganges. The Multanis
of Indeskoi Dvor, or ‘Indian court,’ at Astrakhan, have erected a pantheon,
in which Krishna, the god of all Vaishnava merchants, is seated in front of
Jagannath, Rama, and his brothers, who stand in the background; while
Siva and his consort Ashtabhuja ‘the eight-armed,’ form an intermediate
line, in which is also placed a statue which Pallas denominates Murali;
but Pallas mistook the flute (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>murali</em></span>) of the divine Krishna for a rod. The
principal figure we shall describe in his own words. “In the middle was
placed a small idol with a very high bonnet, called Gupaledshi. At its
right there was a large black stone, and on the left two smaller ones of the
same colour, brought from the Ganges, and regarded by the Hindus as
sacred. These fossils were of the species called Sankara, and appeared to
be an impression of a bivalve muscle.” Minute as is the description, our
judgment is further aided by the plate. Gupaledshi is evidently Gopalji,
the pastoral deity of Vraj (from <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>gao</em></span>, a cow, and <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>pala</em></span>, a herdsman). The
head-dress worn by him and all the others is precisely that still worn by
Krishna, in the sacred dance at Mathura: and so minute is the delineation
that even the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>pera</em></span> or sugar-ball is represented, although the professor
appears to have been ignorant of its use, as he does not name it. He has
likewise omitted to notice the representation of the sacred mount of Govardhana,
which separates him from the Hindu Jove and the turreted Cybele
(Durga), his consort. The black stones are the Salagramas, worshipped
by all Vaishnavas. In the names of ‘Nhandigana and Gori,’ though
the first is called a lion saddled, and the other a male divinity, we easily
recognise Nandi, the bull-attendant (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>Gana</em></span>) of Siva and his consort Gauri.
Were all travellers to describe what they see with the same accuracy as
Pallas, they would confer important obligations on society, and might
defy criticism. It is with heartfelt satisfaction I have to record, from the
authority of a gentleman who has dwelt amongst the Hindkis of Astrakhan,
that distance from their ancient abodes has not deteriorated their character
for uprightness. Mr. Mitchell, from whose knowledge of Oriental languages
the Royal Asiatic Society will some day derive benefit, says that the reputation
of these Hindu colonists, of whom there are about five hundred families,
stands very high, and that they bear a preference over all the merchants
of other nations settled in this great commercial city.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f4.19.73'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r4.19.73'>73</a>. Other travellers besides Pallas have described Hinduism as existing
in the remote parts of the Russian empire, and if nominal resemblances
may be admitted, we would instance the strong analogy between the <em>Samoyedes</em>
and <em>Tchoudes</em> of Siberia and Finland and the Syama Yadus and
Joudes of India [?]. The languages of the two former races are said to have
a strong affinity, and are classed as Hindu-Germanic by M. Klaproth, on
whose learned work, <cite>Asia Polyglotta</cite>, M. Rémusat has given the world an
interesting <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>critique</em></span>, in his <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Mélanges Asiatiques</em></span> (tome i. p. 267), in which
he traces these tribes to Central Asia; thus approaching the land of the
Getae or Yuti. Now the Yutis and Yadus have much in their early history
to warrant the assertion of more than nominal analogy. The annals of
the Yadus of Jaisalmer state that long anterior to Vikrama they held
dominion from Ghazni to Samarkand: that they established themselves
in those regions after the Mahabharata, or great war; and were again
impelled, on the rise of Islamism, within the Indus. As Yadus of the race
of Sham or Syam (a title of Krishna), they would be Sama-Yadus; in like
manner as the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>Bhatti</em></span> tribe are called <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>Shama-bhatti</em></span>, the Ahsham Bhatti of
Abu-l Fazl. The race of <em>Joude</em> was existing near the Indus in the Emperor
Babur’s time, who describes them as occupying the mountainous range
in the first Duab, the very spot mentioned in the annals of the Yadus as
their place of halt, on quitting India twelve centuries before Christ, and
thence called Jadu or Yadu-ka-dang, the ‘hills of Jadu or Yadu.’ The
peopling of all these regions, from the Indus to remote Tartary, is attributed
to the race of Ayu or Indu, both signifying the moon, of which are the
Haihayas, Aswas (<em>Asi</em>), Yadus, etc., who spread a common language over
all Western Asia. Amongst the few words of Hindu-Germanic origin which
M. Rémusat gives to prove affinity between the Finnish and Samoyede
languages is <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“<em>Miel</em>, <em>Mod</em>, dans le dialecte Caucasien, et <em>Méd</em>, en Slave,”</span>
and which, as well as <em>mead</em>, the drink of the Scandinavian warrior, is from
the Sanskrit <span lang="sa" xml:lang="sa"><em>Madhu</em></span>, a bee [honey]. Hence intoxicating beverage is termed
<span lang="sa" xml:lang="sa"><em>Madhva</em></span>, which supplies another epithet for Krishna, <span lang="sa" xml:lang="sa"><em>Madhu</em></span> or <span lang="sa" xml:lang="sa"><em>Madhava</em></span>.

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Krishna.</h4>—Hari, Krishna, familiarly Kanhaiya,<a id='r4.20.1' /><a href='#f4.20.1' class='c013'><sup>[1]</sup></a> was of the
celebrated tribe of Yadu, the founder of the fifty-six tribes<a id='r4.20.2' /><a href='#f4.20.2' class='c013'><sup>[2]</sup></a>
who obtained the universal sovereignty of India, and descended
from Yayati, the third son<a id='r4.20.3' /><a href='#f4.20.3' class='c013'><sup>[3]</sup></a> of Swayambhuva Manu,<a id='r4.20.4' /><a href='#f4.20.4' class='c013'><sup>[4]</sup></a> or ‘The
Man, Lord of the earth,’ whose daughter Ila<a id='r4.20.5' /><a href='#f4.20.5' class='c013'><sup>[5]</sup></a> (<em>Terra</em>) was espoused
by Budha (Mercury), son of Chandra<a id='r4.20.6' /><a href='#f4.20.6' class='c013'><sup>[6]</sup></a> (the Moon), whence the
Yadus are styled Chandravansi, or ‘children of the moon.’
Budha was therefore worshipped as the great [533] ancestor
(<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>Pitrideva</em></span>) of the lunar race; and previous to the apotheosis of
Krishna, was adored by all the Yadu race. The principal shrine
of Budha was at Dwarka, where he still receives adoration as
Budha Trivikrama.<a id='r4.20.7' /><a href='#f4.20.7' class='c013'><sup>[7]</sup></a> Kanhaiya lived towards the conclusion
of the brazen age, calculated to have been about 1100 to 1200
years before Christ.<a id='r4.20.8' /><a href='#f4.20.8' class='c013'><sup>[8]</sup></a> He was born to the inheritance of Vraj,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_622'>622</span>the country of the Suraseni, comprehending the territory round
Mathura for a space of eighty miles, of which he was unjustly
deprived in his infancy by his relative Kansa. From its vicinity
to Delhi we may infer either that there was no lord paramount
amongst the Yadus of this period, or that Krishna’s family held
as vassals of Hastinapur, then, with Indraprastha or Delhi, the
chief seat of Yadu power. There were two princes named Surasen
amongst the immediate predecessors of Krishna: one, his grandfather,
the other eight generations anterior. Which of these
was the founder of Suryapur on the Yamuna, the capital of the
Yadus,<a id='r4.20.9' /><a href='#f4.20.9' class='c013'><sup>[9]</sup></a> we know not, but we may assume that the first gave his
name to the region around Mathura, described by Arrian as the
country of the Suraseni. Alexander was in India probably about
eight centuries after the deification of Krishna, and it is satisfactory
to find that the inquiries he instituted into the genealogy
of the dynasty then ruling on the [534] Yamuna correspond very
closely with those of the Yadus of this distant period; and combined
with what Arrian says of the origin of the Pandus, it appears
indisputable that the descendants of this powerful branch of the
Yadus ruled on the Yamuna when the Macedonian erected the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_623'>623</span>altars of Greece on the Indus. That the personage whose epithets
of Krishna-Syam designate his colour as ‘the Black Prince,’ was
in fact a distinguished chief of the Yadus, there is not a shadow
of doubt; nor that, after his death, they placed him among the
gods as an incarnation of Vishnu or the Sun; and from this period
we may induce the Hindu notion of their Trinity. Arrian<a id='r4.20.10' /><a href='#f4.20.10' class='c013'><sup>[10]</sup></a>
enumerates the names of Boudyas (Βουδύας) and Kradeuas
(Κραδεύας) amongst the early ancestors of the tribe then in
power, which would alone convince us that Alexander had access
to the genealogies of the Puranas; for we can have little hesitation
in affirming these to be Budha and Kroshti, ancestors of
Krishna; and that “Mathora and Cleisobora, the chief cities
of the Suraseni,” are the Mathura and Suryapur occupied by the
descendants of Sursen.<a id='r4.20.11' /><a href='#f4.20.11' class='c013'><sup>[11]</sup></a> Had Arrian afforded as many hints for
discussing the analogy between the Hindu and Grecian Apollos
as he has for the Hercules of Thebes and India, we might have
come to a conclusion that the three chief divinities<a id='r4.20.12' /><a href='#f4.20.12' class='c013'><sup>[12]</sup></a> of Egypt,
Greece, and India had their altars first erected on the Indus,
Ganges, and Jumna.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Sun and Moon Worship.</h4>—The earliest objects of adoration in
these regions were the sun and moon, whose names designated
the two grand races, Surya and Chandra of Indu. Budha, son
of Indu, married Ila, a grandchild of Surya, from which union
sprung the Indu race. They deified their ancestor Budha, who
continued to be the chief object of adoration until Krishna:
hence the worship of Balnath<a id='r4.20.13' /><a href='#f4.20.13' class='c013'><sup>[13]</sup></a> and Budha<a id='r4.20.14' /><a href='#f4.20.14' class='c013'><sup>[14]</sup></a> were coeval. That
the Nomadic tribes of Arabia, as well as those of Tartary and
India, adored the same objects, we learn from the earliest writers;
and Job, the probable contemporary of Hasti, the founder of the
first capital of the Yadus on the Ganges, boasts in the midst of
his griefs that he had always remained uncorrupted by the
Sabaeism which surrounded him. “If I beheld the sun when it
shined, or the moon walking in brightness, and my mouth had
kissed my hand, this also were an iniquity to be punished by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_624'>624</span>judge, for I should have denied the [535] God that is above.”<a id='r4.20.15' /><a href='#f4.20.15' class='c013'><sup>[15]</sup></a>
That there were many Hindus who, professing a pure monotheism
like Job, never kissed the hand either to Surya or his herald
Budha, we may easily credit from the sublimity of the notions of
the ‘One God,’ expressed both by the ancients and moderns,
by poets and by princes, of both races;<a id='r4.20.16' /><a href='#f4.20.16' class='c013'><sup>[16]</sup></a> but more especially by
the sons of Budha, who for ages bowed not before graven images,
and deemed it impious to raise a temple to</div>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The Spirit in whose honour shrines are weak.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Hence the Jains, the chief sect of the Buddhists,<a id='r4.20.17' /><a href='#f4.20.17' class='c013'><sup>[17]</sup></a> so called from
adoring the spirit (Jina), were untinctured with idolatry until
the apotheosis of Krishna,<a id='r4.20.18' /><a href='#f4.20.18' class='c013'><sup>[18]</sup></a> whose mysteries superseded the
simpler worship of Budha. Neminath (the deified Nemi) was
the pontiff of Budha, and not only the contemporary of Krishna,
but a Yadu, and his near relation; and both had epithets denoting
their complexion; for Arishta, the surname of Nemi, has the
same import as Syam and Krishna, ‘the black,’ though the latter
is of a less Ethiopic hue than Nemi.<a id='r4.20.19' /><a href='#f4.20.19' class='c013'><sup>[19]</sup></a> It was anterior to this
schism amongst the sons of Budha that the creative power was
degraded under sensual forms, when the pillar rose to Bal or
Surya in Syria and on the Ganges: and the serpent, “subtlest
beast of all the field,” worshipped as the emblem of wisdom
(Budha), was conjoined with the symbol of the creative power,
as at the shrine of Eklinga, where the brazen serpent is wreathed
round the lingam.<a id='r4.20.20' /><a href='#f4.20.20' class='c013'><sup>[20]</sup></a> Budha’s descendants, the Indus, preserved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_625'>625</span>the Ophite sign of their race, when Krishna’s followers adopted
the eagle as his symbol. These, with the adorers of Surya, form
the three idolatrous classes of India, not confined to its modern
[536] restricted definition, but that of antiquity, when Industhan
or Indu-Scythia extended from the Ganges to the Caspian. In
support of the position that the existing polytheism was unknown
on the rise of Vaishnavism, we may state, that in none of the
ancient genealogies do the names of such deities appear as proper
names in society, a practice now common; and it is even recorded
that the rites of magic, the worship of the host of heaven, and
of idols, were introduced from Kashmir, between the periods of
Krishna and Vikrama. The powers of nature were personified,
and each quality, mental and physical, had its emblem, which
the Brahmans taught the ignorant to adopt as realities, till the
pantheon become so crowded that life would be too short to
acquire even the nomenclature of their ‘thirty-three millions
of gods.’<a id='r4.20.21' /><a href='#f4.20.21' class='c013'><sup>[21]</sup></a> No object was too high or too base, from the glorious
Orb to the Rampi, or paring-knife of the shoemaker. In illustration
of the increase of polytheism, I shall describe the seven forms
under which Krishna is worshipped, whose statues are established
in the various capitals of Rajasthan, and are occasionally brought
together at the festival of Annakuta at Nathdwara.</p>

<p class='c001'>The international wars of the Suryas and the Yadu races, as
described in the Ramayana and Mahabharata, are lost between
allegory and literal interpretation. The Suryas, or Saivas, were
depressed; and the Indus, who counted ‘fifty-six’ grand
tribes, under the appellations of Takshak, ‘serpent,’ Aswa,
‘horse,’ Sasa, ‘hare,’ etc., etc., had paramount sway. Krishna’s
schism produced a new type, that of the eagle, and the wars of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_626'>626</span>the schismatics were depicted under their respective emblems,
the eagle and serpent, of which latter were the Kauravas and
Takshaks,<a id='r4.20.22' /><a href='#f4.20.22' class='c013'><sup>[22]</sup></a> the political adversaries of the Pandus, the relatives
of Krishna. The [537] allegory of Krishna’s eagle pursuing the
serpent Budha, and recovering the books of science and religion
with which he fled, is an historical fact disguised: namely, that
of Krishna incorporating the doctrines of Budha with his own
after the expulsion of the sect from India. Dare we further
attempt to lift the veil from this mystery, and trace from the seat
of redemption of lost science its original source?<a id='r4.20.23' /><a href='#f4.20.23' class='c013'><sup>[23]</sup></a> The Gulf of
Cutch, the point where the serpent attempted to escape, has been
from time immemorial to the present day the entrepôt for the
commerce of Sofala, the Red Sea, Egypt, and Arabia. There
<span class='pageno' id='Page_627'>627</span>Budha Trivikrama, or Mercury, has been and is yet invoked by
the Indian mariners, especially the pirates of Dwarka. Did
Budha or Mercury come from, or escape to the Nile? Is he the
Hermes of Egypt to whom the ‘four books of science,’ like the
four Vedas<a id='r4.20.24' /><a href='#f4.20.24' class='c013'><sup>[24]</sup></a> of the Hindus, were sacred? The statues of Nemi,<a id='r4.20.25' /><a href='#f4.20.25' class='c013'><sup>[25]</sup></a>
the representative of Budha, exactly resemble in feature the bust
of young Memnon.<a id='r4.20.26' /><a href='#f4.20.26' class='c013'><sup>[26]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>I have already observed that Krishna, before his own deification,
worshipped his great ancestor Budha; and his temple at
Dwarka rose over the ancient shrine of the latter, which yet
stands. In an inscription from the cave of Gaya their characters
are conjoined: “Hari who is Budha.” According to
Western mythology, Apollo and Mercury exchanged symbols,
the caduceus for the lyre; so likewise in India their characters
intermingle: and even the Saiva propitiates Hari as the mediator
and disposer of the ‘divine spark’ (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>jyoti</em></span>) to its reunion with the
‘parent-flame’:—thus, like Mercury, he may be said to be the
conveyer of the souls of the dead. Accordingly in funeral
lamentation his name only is invoked, and <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>Hari-bol! Hari-bol!</em></span>
is emphatically pronounced by those conveying the corpse to its
final abode. The <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>vahan</em></span> (<em>qu.</em> the Saxon <em>van</em>?) or celestial car of
Krishna, in which the souls (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>ansa</em></span>) of the just are conveyed to
Suryamandal, the ‘mansion of the sun,’ is painted like himself,
blue (indicative of space, or as Ouranos), with the eagle’s head;
and here he partakes of the Mercury of the [538] Greeks, and of
Oulios, the preserver or saviour, one of the titles of Apollo at Delos.<a id='r4.20.27' /><a href='#f4.20.27' class='c013'><sup>[27]</sup></a></p>

<div class='section-start'><span class='pageno' id='Page_628'>628</span><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Forms of Krishna.</h4>—The Tatar nations, who are all of
Indu race, like the Rajputs and German tribes, adored the moon
as a male divinity, and to his son, Budha, they assign the same
character of mediator. The serpent is alike the symbol of the
Budha of the Hindus, the Hermes of the Egyptians, and the
Mercury of Greece: and the allegory of the dragon’s teeth, the
origin of letters, brought by Cadmus from Egypt, is a version of
the Hindu fable of Kanhaiya (Apollo) wresting the Vedas (secrets)
from Budha or wisdom (Hermes), under his sign, the serpent or
dragon. We might still further elucidate the resemblance, and
by an analysis of the titles and attributes of the Hindu Apollo,
prove that from the Yamuna may have been supplied the various
incarnations of this divinity, which peopled the pantheons of
Egypt, Greece, and Rome. As Nomios, who attended the herds
of Admetus, we have Nonita,<a id='r4.20.28' /><a href='#f4.20.28' class='c013'><sup>[28]</sup></a> the infantine appellation of
Kanhaiya, when he pastured the kine of Kesava in the woods
of Vindra, whence the ceremony of the sons of princes assuming
the crook, and on particular days tending the flocks.<a id='r4.20.29' /><a href='#f4.20.29' class='c013'><sup>[29]</sup></a> As
Muralidhara, or the ‘flute-holder,’ Kanhaiya is the god of music;
and in giving him the shepherd’s reed instead of the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>vina</em></span> or lyre,
we may conjecture that the simple bamboo (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>bans</em></span>) which formed
the first flute (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>bansli</em></span>) was in use before the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>chahtara</em></span>,<a id='r4.20.30' /><a href='#f4.20.30' class='c013'><sup>[30]</sup></a> the Grecian
cithara,<a id='r4.20.31' /><a href='#f4.20.31' class='c013'><sup>[31]</sup></a> the first invented lyre of Apollo. Thus from the six-wired
<span class='pageno' id='Page_629'>629</span>instrument of the Hindus we have the Greek cithara, the
English cithern, and the Spanish guitar of modern [539] days.
The Greeks, following the Egyptians, had but six notes, with
their lettered symbols; and it was reserved for the Italians to
add a seventh. Guido Aretine, a monk in the thirteenth century,
has the credit of this. I, however, believe the Hindus numbered
theirs from the heavenly bodies—the Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus,
Mars, Jupiter, Saturn,—hence they had the regular octave, with
its semi-tones: and as, in the pruriency of their fancy, they
converted the ascending and descending notes into <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>grahas</em></span>, or
planetary bodies, so they may have added them to the harmonious
numbers, and produced the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>nauragini</em></span>, their <em>nine</em> modes of music.<a id='r4.20.32' /><a href='#f4.20.32' class='c013'><sup>[32]</sup></a>
Could we affirm that the hymns composed and set to music by
Jayadeva, nearly three thousand years ago,<a id='r4.20.33' /><a href='#f4.20.33' class='c013'><sup>[33]</sup></a> and still chanted in
honour of the Apollo of Vraj, had been handed down with the
sentiments of these mystic compositions (and Sir W. Jones
sanctions the idea), we should say, from their simplicity, that
the musicians of that age had only the diatonic scale; but we
have every reason to believe, from the very elaborate character
of their written music, which is painful and discordant to the
ear from its minuteness of subdivision, that they had also the
chromatic scale, said to have been invented by Timotheus in the
time of Alexander, who might have carried it from the banks of
the Indus.</div>

lose no opportunity of lauding themselves; of which Jayadeva,

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_631'>631</span>The poet opens the first interview of Krishna and Radha with
an animated description of a night in the rainy season, in which
Hari is represented as a wanderer, and Radha, daughter of the
shepherd Nanda, is sent to offer him shelter in their cot.<a id='r4.20.37' /><a href='#f4.20.37' class='c013'><sup>[37]</sup></a> Nanda
thus speaks to Radha: “The firmament is obscured by clouds;
the woodlands are black with Tamala trees; that youth who
roves in the forest will be fearful in the gloom of night; go, my
daughter, bring the wanderer to my rustic mansion. Such was
the command of Nanda the herdsman, and hence arose the love
of Radha and Madhava.”<a id='r4.20.38' /><a href='#f4.20.38' class='c013'><sup>[38]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The poet proceeds to apostrophize Hari, which the Hindu
bard terms <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>rupaka</em></span>, or ‘personal description’:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh thou who reclinest on the bosom of Kamala, whose ears
flame with gems, and whose locks are embellished with sylvan
flowers; thou, from whom the [541] day-star derived his effulgence,
who slewest the venom-breathing Kaliya, who beamedst
like a sun on the tribe of Yadu, that flourished like a lotus;
thou, who sittest on the plumage of Garuda, who sippest nectar
from the radiant lips of Padma, as the fluttering chakora drinks
the moonbeams; be victorious, O Hari.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Jayadeva then introduces Hari in the society of the pastoral
nymphs of Vraj, whom he groups with admirable skill, expressing
the passion by which each is animated towards the youthful
prince with great warmth and elegance of diction. But Radha,
indignant that he should divide with them the affection she
deemed exclusively her own, flies his presence. Hari, repentant
and alarmed, now searches the forest for his beloved, giving vent
at each step to impassioned grief. “Woe is me! she feels a
sense of injured honour, and has departed in wrath. How will
she conduct herself? How will she express her pain in so long
a separation? What is wealth to me? What are numerous
attendants? What the pleasures of the world? How can I
invite thee to return? Grant me but a sight of thee, oh! lovely
Radha, for my passion torments me. O God of love! mistake
me not for Siva. Wound me not again. I love already but too
passionately; yet have I lost my beloved. Brace not thy bow,
thou conqueror of the world! My heart is already pierced by
arrows from Radha’s eyes, black and keen as those of the antelope.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_632'>632</span>Radha relents and sends a damsel in quest of Hari, whom she
finds in a solitary arbour on the banks of the Yamuna. She
describes her mistress as animated by the same despair which
controls him:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Her face is like a water-lily veiled in the dew of tears, and
her eyes are as moons eclipsed. She draws thy picture and
worships it, and at the close of every sentence exclaims, ‘O
Madhava, at thy feet am I fallen!’ Then she figures thee standing
before her: she sighs, she smiles, she mourns, she weeps.
Her abode, the forest—herself through thy absence is become
a timid roe, and love is the tiger who springs on her, like Yama,
the genius of death. So emaciated is her beautiful body, that
even the light garland which waves o’er her bosom is a load.
The palm of her hand supports her aching temple, motionless as
the crescent rising at eve. Thus, O divine healer, by the nectar
of thy love [542] must Radha be restored to health; and if thou
refusest, thy heart must be harder than the thunder-stone.”<a id='r4.20.39' /><a href='#f4.20.39' class='c013'><sup>[39]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The damsel returns to Radha and reports the condition of
Hari, mourning her absence: “Even the hum of the bee distracts
him. Misery sits fixed in his heart, and every returning
night adds anguish to anguish.” She then recommends Radha
to seek him. “Delay not, O loveliest of women; follow the
lord of thy heart. Having bound his locks with forest flowers,
he hastens to yon arbour, where a soft gale breathes over the
banks of Yamuna, and there pronouncing thy name, he modulates
his divine reed. Leave behind thee, O friend, the ring which
tinkles on thy delicate ankle when thou sportest in the dance.
Cast over thee thy azure mantle and run to the shady bower.”</p>

<p class='c001'>But Radha, too weak to move, is thus reported to Hari by
the same fair mediator: “She looks eagerly on all sides in hope
of thy approach: she advances a few steps and falls languid to
the ground. She weaves bracelets of fresh leaves, and looking
at herself in sport, exclaims, behold the vanquisher of Madhu!
Then she repeats the name of Hari, and catching at a dark blue
cloud,<a id='r4.20.40' /><a href='#f4.20.40' class='c013'><sup>[40]</sup></a> strives to embrace it, saying, ‘It is my beloved who
approaches.’”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_633'>633</span>Midnight arrives, but neither Hari nor the damsel returns,
when she gives herself up to the frenzy of despair, exclaiming:
“The perfidy of my friend rends my heart. Bring disease and
death, O gale of Malaya! receive me in thy azure wave, O sister
of Yama,<a id='r4.20.41' /><a href='#f4.20.41' class='c013'><sup>[41]</sup></a> that the ardour of my heart may be allayed.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The repentant Hari at length returns, and in speech well
calculated to win forgiveness, thus pleads his pardon:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh! grant me a draught of honey from the lotus of thy
mouth: or if thou art inexorable, grant me death from the
arrows of thine eyes; make thy arms my chains: thou art my
ornament; thou art the pearl in the ocean of my mortal birth!
Thine eyes, which nature formed like blue water-lilies, are become
through thy resentment like petals of the crimson lotus! Thy
silence affects me; oh! speak with the voice of music, and let
thy sweet accents allay my ardour” [543].</p>

<p class='c001'>“Radha with timid joy, darting her eyes on Govinda while she
musically sounded the rings of her ankles and the bells of her
zone,<a id='r4.20.42' /><a href='#f4.20.42' class='c013'><sup>[42]</sup></a> entered the mystic bower of her beloved. His heart was
agitated by her sight, as the waves of the deep are affected by
the lunar orb.<a id='r4.20.43' /><a href='#f4.20.43' class='c013'><sup>[43]</sup></a> From his graceful waist flowed a pale yellow

over its blue petals.<a id='r4.20.45' /><a href='#f4.20.45' class='c013'><sup>[45]</sup></a> His locks interwoven with blossoms, were
like a cloud variegated by the moonbeam. Tears of transport

before taken its abode in their dark pupils, was itself ashamed,<a id='r4.20.46' /><a href='#f4.20.46' class='c013'><sup>[46]</sup></a>
and departed when the fawn-eyed Radha gazed on the bright
face of Krishna.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_634'>634</span>The poet proceeds to describe Apollo’s bower on the sable

<p class='c015'>In the morning the blue god aids in Radha’s simple toilet.
He stains her eye with antimony “which would make the blackest
bee envious,” places “a circle of musk on her forehead,” and
intertwines “a chaplet of flowers and peacock’s feathers in her
dark tresses,” replacing “the zone of golden bells.” The bard
concludes as he commenced, with an eulogium on the inspirations
of his muse, which it is evident were set to music. “Whatever
is delightful in the modes of music, whatever is graceful in the
fine strains of poetry, whatever is exquisite in the sweet art of
love, let the happy and wise learn from the songs of Jayadeva.”</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Rāsmandal Dance.</h4>—This mystic dance, the <em>rasmandal</em>,
appears analogous to the Pyrrhic dance, or the fire-dance of the
Egyptians. The movements of those who personate the deity
and his fair companions are full [544] of grace, and the dialogue
is replete with harmony.<a id='r4.20.48' /><a href='#f4.20.48' class='c013'><sup>[48]</sup></a> The Chaubes<a id='r4.20.49' /><a href='#f4.20.49' class='c013'><sup>[49]</sup></a> of Mathura and Vindravana
have considerable reputation as vocalists; and the effect
of the modulated and deep tones of the adult blending with the
clear treble of the juvenile performers, while the time is marked
by the cymbal or the soothing monotony of the tabor, accompanied
occasionally by the <em>murali</em> or flute, is very pleasing.</div>

<div class='section-start'><span class='pageno' id='Page_635'>635</span><h4 class='disp-inline'>Govardhana.</h4>—We have a Parnassus in Govardhana, from
which sacred hill the god derives one of his principal epithets,
Gordhan or Gordhannath, ‘God of the mount of wealth.’<a id='r4.20.50' /><a href='#f4.20.50' class='c013'><sup>[50]</sup></a> Here
he first gave proofs of miraculous power, and a cave in this hill
was the first shrine, on his apotheosis, whence his miracles and
oracles were made known to the Yadus. From this cave (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>gupha</em></span>)
is derived another of his titles—Guphnath, ‘Lord of the cave,’
distinct from his epithet Gopinath, ‘Lord of the Gopis,’<a id='r4.20.51' /><a href='#f4.20.51' class='c013'><sup>[51]</sup></a> or pastoral
nymphs. On the annual festival held at Govardhana, the sacred
mount is purified with copious oblations of milk, for which all
the cows of the district are in requisition.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Cave Worship of Krishna.</h4>—The worship of Krishna in ancient
days, like that of Apollo amongst the Greeks, was chiefly celebrated
in caves, of which there were many scattered over India. The
most remarkable were those of Govardhana in Vraj; Gaya in
Bihar; Gopnath on the shores of Saurashtra; and Jalandhara<a id='r4.20.52' /><a href='#f4.20.52' class='c013'><sup>[52]</sup></a>
on the Indus. In these dark and mysterious retreats superstition
had her full influence over the votaries who sought the commands
and deprecated the wrath of the deity: but, as the Mukhya told
the author, “the age of oracles and miracles is past”; and the
new wheel, which was miraculously furnished each revolving
year to supply the place of that which first indicated his desire
to abide at Nathdwara, is no longer forthcoming. The old one,
which was the signal of his wish, is, however, preserved as a relic,
and greatly reverenced. The statue now worshipped at Nathdwara,
as the representative of ‘the god of the mount’ [545], is
said to be the identical image raised in the cave of Govardhana,
and brought thence by the high priest Balba.<a id='r4.20.53' /><a href='#f4.20.53' class='c013'><sup>[53]</sup></a></div>

<div class='section-start'><span class='pageno' id='Page_636'>636</span><h4 class='disp-inline'>Krishna a Dragon-Slayer.</h4>—As the destroyer of Kaliyanag,
‘the black serpent,’ which infested the waters of the Yamuna,
Kanhaiya has the character of the Pythic Apollo. He is represented
dragging the monster from the ‘black stream,’ and
bruising him with his foot. He had, however, many battles with
his hydra-foe ere he vanquished him, and he was once driven by
Kalayavana from Vraj to Dwarka, whence his title of Ranchhor.
Here we have the old allegory of the schismatic wars of the
Buddhists and Vaishnavas.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Parallels to Krishna in other Mythologies.</h4>—Diodorus informs
us that <em>Kan</em> was one of the titles of the Egyptian Apollo as the
sun; and this is the common contraction for Kanhaiya, whose
colour is a dark cerulean blue (<em>nila</em>): and hence his name Nilanath,
who, like the Apollo of the Nile, is depicted with the human
form and eagle-head, with a lotus in his hand. S and H are permutable
letters in the Bhakha, and Syam or Sham, the god of the
Yamuna, may be the <em>Ham</em> or Hammon of Egypt. Hari accompanied
Rama to Lanka, as did the Egyptian Apollo, Rameses-Sesostris,
on his expedition to India: both were attended in their
expedition by an army of Satyrs, or tribes bearing the names of
different animals: and as we have the Aswas, the Takshaks, and
the Sasas of the Yadu tribes, typified under the horse, the serpent,
and the hare, so the races of Surya, of which Rama was the head,
may have been designated Riksh and Hanuman, or bears and
monkeys. The distance of the Nile from the Indian shore forms
no objection; the sail spread for Ceylon could waft the vessel
to the Red Sea, which the fleets of Tyre, of Solomon, and Hiram
covered about this very time. That the Hindus navigated the
ocean from the earliest ages, the traces of their religion in the
isles of the Indian archipelago sufficiently attest; but on this
subject we have already said enough.</div>

<p class='c001'>The coincidence between the most common epithets of the
Apollos of Greece and India, as applied to the sun, are peculiarly
striking. Hari, as Bhannath, ‘the lord of beams,’ is Phoebus,
and his heaven is Haripur (Heliopolis), or ‘city of Hari.’<a id='r4.20.54' /><a href='#f4.20.54' class='c013'><sup>[54]</sup></a> Helios
(Ἥλιος) was a title of Apollo, whence the Greeks had their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_637'>637</span>Elysium, the Haripur or Bhanthan (the abode of the sun), the
highest of the [546] heavens or abodes of bliss of the martial
Rajput. Hence the eagle (the emblem of Hari as the sun)<a id='r4.20.55' /><a href='#f4.20.55' class='c013'><sup>[55]</sup></a> was
adopted by the western warrior as the symbol of victory.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Di Majores of the Rajput are the same in number and
title as amongst the Greeks and Romans, being the deities who
figuratively preside over the planetary system. Their grades of
bliss are therefore in unison with the eccentricity of orbit of the
planet named. On this account Chandra or Indu, the moon,
being a mere satellite of Ila, the earth, though probably originating
the name of the Indu race, is inferior in the scale of blissful
abodes to that of his son Budha or Mercury, whose heliacal
appearance gave him importance even with the sons of Vaivasvata,
the sun. From the poetic seers of the martial races we learn
that there are two distinct places of reward; the one essentially
spiritual, the other of a material nature. The bard inculcates
that the warrior who falls in battle in the fulfilment of his duty,
“who abandons life through the wave of steel,” will know no
“second birth,” but that the unconfined spark (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>jyotis</em></span>) will reunite
to the parent orb. The doctrine of transmigration through a
variety of hideous forms may be considered as a series of purgatories.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Greeks and Celts worshipped Apollo under the title of
Carneios,<a id='r4.20.56' /><a href='#f4.20.56' class='c013'><sup>[56]</sup></a> which <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“selon le scholiaste de Théocrite”</span> is derived
from Carnos, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“qui ne prophétisoit que des malheurs aux Héraclides
lors de leur incursion dans le Péloponnèse. Un d’eux
appelé <em>Hippotés, le tua d’un coup de flèche</em>.”</span> Now one of the
titles of the Hindu Apollo is Karna, ‘the radiant’; from <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>karna</em></span>,
‘a ray’: and when he led the remains of the Harikulas in company
<span class='pageno' id='Page_638'>638</span>with Baldeva (the god of strength), and Yudhishthira, after the
great international war, into the Peloponnesus of Saurashtra,
they were attacked by the aboriginal Bhils, one of whom slew
the divine Karna with an arrow. The Bhils claim to be of
Hayavansa, or the race of Haya, whose chief seat was at Maheswar
on the Nerbudda: the assassin of Karna would consequently
be Hayaputra, or descendant of Haya<a id='r4.20.57' /><a href='#f4.20.57' class='c013'><sup>[57]</sup></a> [547].</p>

<p class='c001'>The most celebrated of the monuments commonly termed
Druidic, scattered throughout Europe, is at Carnac in Brittany,
on which coast the Celtic Apollo had his shrines, and was propitiated
under the title of Karneios, and this monument may be
considered at once sacred to the manes of the warriors and the
sun-god Karneios. Thus the Roman Saturnalia, the <em>carnivale</em>,
has a better etymology in the festival to Karneios, as the sun,
than in the ‘adieu to flesh’ during the fast. The character of
this festival is entirely oriental, and accompanied with the
licentiousness which belonged to the celebration of the powers
of nature. Even now, although Christianity has banished the
grosser forms, it partakes more of a Pagan than a Christian
ceremony.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Annakūta Festival.</h4>—Of the festivals of Krishna the
Annakuta is the most remarkable;<a id='r4.20.58' /><a href='#f4.20.58' class='c013'><sup>[58]</sup></a> when the seven statues were
brought from the different capitals of Rajasthan, and mountains
(<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>kuta</em></span>) of food (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>anna</em></span>) piled up for their repast, at a given signal
are levelled by the myriads of votaries assembled from all parts.
About eighty years ago, on a memorable assemblage at the
Annakuta, before warfare had devastated Rajasthan, and circumscribed
the means of the faithful disciples of Hari, amongst
the multitude of Vaishnavas of every region were almost all the
Rajput princes; Rana Arsi of Mewar, Raja Bijai Singh of Marwar,
Raja Gaj Singh of Bikaner, and Bahadur Singh of Kishangarh.
Rana Arsi presented to the god a <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>tora</em></span>, or massive golden anklet-chain
set with emeralds: Bijai Singh a diamond necklace worth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_639'>639</span>twenty-five thousand rupees: the other princes according to
their means. They were followed by an old woman of Surat,
with infirm step and shaking head, who deposited four coppers
in the hand of the high-priest, which were received with a gracious
smile, not vouchsafed to the lords of the earth. “The Rand is
in luck,” whispered the chief of Kishangarh to the Rana. Soon
afterwards the statue of Hari was brought forth, when the same
old woman placed at its feet a bill of exchange for seventy thousand
rupees. The mighty were humbled, and the smile of the Gosain
was explained. Such gifts, and to a yet greater amount, are, or
were, by no means uncommon from the sons of commerce, who
are only known to belong to the flock from the distinguishing
necklace of the sect.<a id='r4.20.59' /><a href='#f4.20.59' class='c013'><sup>[59]</sup></a></div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Interruption of Worship.</h4>—The predatory system which
reduced these countries to a state of the most degraded anarchy,
greatly diminished the number of pilgrimages to Nathdwara [548];
and the gods of Vraj had sufficient prescience to know that they
could guard neither their priests nor followers from the Pathan
and Mahratta, to whom the crown of the god, or the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>nathna</em></span>
(nose-jewel) of Radha, would be alike acceptable: nor would they
have scrupled to retain both the deities and priests as hostages
for such imposition as they might deem within their means.
Accordingly, of late years, there had been no congress of the gods
of Vraj, who remained fixtures on their altars till the halcyon
days of <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1818 permitted their liberation.<a id='r4.20.60' /><a href='#f4.20.60' class='c013'><sup>[60]</sup></a></div>

<p class='c015'>Nathji is not enumerated amongst the forms; he stands
supreme.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nonita, or Nonanda, the juvenile Kanhaiya, has his altar
separate, though close to Nathji. He is also styled Balamukund,
‘the blessed child,’<a id='r4.20.63' /><a href='#f4.20.63' class='c013'><sup>[63]</sup></a> and is depicted as an infant with <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>pera</em></span><a id='r4.20.64' /><a href='#f4.20.64' class='c013'><sup>[64]</sup></a> or
comfit-ball in his hand. This image, which was one of the
penates of a former age, and which, since the destruction of the
shrines of [549] Krishna by the Islamites, had lain in the Yamuna,
attached itself to the sacerdotal zone (Janeo) of the high-priest
Balba, while he was performing his ablutions, who, carrying it
home, placed it in a niche of the temple and worshipped it: and
Nonanda yet receives the peculiar homage of the high-priest and
his family as their household divinity. Of the second image,
Mathuranath, there is no particular mention: it was at one time
at Khamnor in Mewar, but is now at Kotah.</p>

<p class='c001'>Balkrishna, the third son, had Dwarkanath, which statue, now
at Kankroli in Mewar, is asserted to be the identical image that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_641'>641</span>received the adoration of Raja Amaraka, a prince of the solar
race who lived in the Satya Yuga, or silver age. The ‘god of
the mount’ revealed himself in a dream to his high-priest, and
told him of the domicile of this his representative at Kanauj.
Thither Balba repaired, and having obtained it from the Brahman,
appointed Damodardas Khatri to officiate at his altar.</p>

<p class='c001'>The fourth statue, that of Gokulnath, or Gokul Chandrama
(<em>i.e.</em> the <em>moon</em> of Gokul), had an equally mysterious origin, having
been discovered in a deep ravine on the banks of the river; Balba
assigned it to his brother-in-law. Gokul is an island on the
Jumna,<a id='r4.20.65' /><a href='#f4.20.65' class='c013'><sup>[65]</sup></a> a few miles below Mathura, and celebrated in the early
history of the pastoral divinity. The residence of this image
at Jaipur does not deprive the little island of its honours as a
place of pilgrimage; for the ‘god of Gokul’ has an altar on the
original site, and his rites are performed by an aged priestess,
who disowns the jurisdiction of the high-priest of Nathdwara,
both in the spiritual and temporal concerns of her shrine; and
who, to the no small scandal of all who are interested in Apollo,
appealed from the fiat of the high-priest to the British court of
justice. The royal grants of the Mogul emperors were produced,
which proved the right to lie in the high-priest, though a long
period of almost undisturbed authority had created a feeling of
independent control in the family of the priestess, which they
desired might continue. A compromise ensued, when the Author
was instrumental in restoring harmony to the shrines of Apollo.</p>

<p class='c001'>The fifth, Yadunath, is the deified ancestor of the whole Yadu
race. This image, now at Surat, formerly adorned the shrine
of Mahaban near Mathura which was destroyed by Mahmud [550].</p>

<p class='c001'>The sixth, Vitthalnath, or Pandurang,<a id='r4.20.66' /><a href='#f4.20.66' class='c013'><sup>[66]</sup></a> was found in the Ganges
at Benares, Samvat 1572 (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1516), from which we may judge
of their habit of multiplying divinities.</p>

<p class='c001'>The seventh, Madan Mohana, ‘he who intoxicates with desire,’
the seductive lover of Radha and the Gopis, has his rites performed
by a female. The present priestess of Mohana is the
mother of Damodara, the supreme head of all who adore the
Apollo of Vraj.</p>

<div class='section-start'><span class='pageno' id='Page_642'>642</span><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Pontiff of Nāthdwāra.</h4>—I am not aware of the precise
period of Balba Acharya, who thus collected the seven images
of Krishna now in Rajasthan; but he must have lived about
the time of the last of the Lodi kings, at the period of the conquest
of India by the Moguls (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1526). The present pontiff, Damodara,
as before said, is his lineal descendant; and whether in addressing
him verbally or by letter he is styled Maharaja or ‘great prince.’<a id='r4.20.67' /><a href='#f4.20.67' class='c013'><sup>[67]</sup></a></div>

<p class='c001'>As the supreme head of the Vishnu sect his person is held
to be Ansa, or ‘a portion of the divinity’; and it is maintained
that so late as the father of the present incumbent, the god
manifested himself and conversed with the high-priest. The
present pontiff is now about thirty years of age. He is of a
benign aspect, with much dignity of demeanour: courteous, yet
exacting the homage due to his high calling: meek, as becomes
the priest of Govinda, but with the finished manners of one accustomed
to the first society. His features are finely moulded, and
his complexion good. He is about the middle size, though as
he rises to no mortal, I could not exactly judge of his height.
When I saw him he had one only daughter, to whom he is much
attached. He has but one wife, nor does Krishna allow polygamy
to his priest. In times of danger, like some of his prototypes in
the dark ages of Europe, he poised the lance, and found it more
effective than spiritual anathemas, against those who would first
adore the god, and then plunder him. Such were the Mahratta
chiefs, Jaswant Rao Holkar and Bapu Sindhia. Damodara
accordingly made the [551] tour of his extensive diocese at the
head of four hundred horse, two standards of foot, and two field-pieces.
He rode the finest mares in the country; laid aside his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_643'>643</span>pontificals for the quilted <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>dagla</em></span>, and was summoned to matins
by the kettle-drum instead of the bell and cymbal. In this he
only imitated Kanhaiya, who often mixed in the ranks of battle,
and “dyed his saffron robe in the red-stained field.” Had
Damodara been captured on one of these occasions by any marauding
Pathan, and incarcerated, as he assuredly would have been,
for ransom, the marauder might have replied to the Rana, as did
the Plantagenet king to the Pope, when the surrender of the
captive church-militant bishop was demanded, “Is this thy son
Joseph’s coat?” But, notwithstanding this display of martial
principle, which covered with a helmet the shaven crown, his
conduct and character are amiable and unexceptionable, and he
furnishes a striking contrast to the late head of the Vishnu establishments
in Marwar, who commenced with the care of his master’s
conscience, and ended with that of the State; meek and unassuming
till he added temporal<a id='r4.20.68' /><a href='#f4.20.68' class='c013'><sup>[68]</sup></a> to spiritual power, which

<p class='c001'>“Twenty-five years of the Dwapar (the brazen age) were yet unexpired,
when the incarnation (<em>avatar</em>) of Sri Krishna took place. Of these, eleven
were passed at Gokul,<a id='r4.20.8.A' /><a href='#f4.20.8.A' class='c013'><sup>[A]</sup></a> and fourteen at Mathura. There he used to manifest
himself personally, especially at Govardhan. But when the Kaliyug (the

ocean from Bharatkand,<a id='r4.20.8.B' /><a href='#f4.20.8.B' class='c013'><sup>[B]</sup></a> where he passed a hundred years before he went

should be overturned, and that the Turushka<a id='r4.20.8.C' /><a href='#f4.20.8.C' class='c013'><sup>[C]</sup></a> should rule. Then the
<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>jizya</em></span>, or capitation tax, was inflicted on the head of the Hindu. Their
faith also suffered much from the Jains and the various infidel (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>asura</em></span>) sects
which abounded. The Jains were so hostile, that Brahma manifested
himself in the shape of Sankaracharya who destroyed them and their
religion at Benares. In Gujarat, by their magic, they made the moon
appear at Amavas.<a id='r4.20.8.D' /><a href='#f4.20.8.D' class='c013'><sup>[D]</sup></a> Sankara foretold to its prince, Siddhraj,<a id='r4.20.8.E' /><a href='#f4.20.8.E' class='c013'><sup>[E]</sup></a> the flood

<p class='c001'><a href='#r4.20.22'>22</a>. The Mahabharata records constant wars from ancient times amongst
the children of Surya (the sun), and the Tak or Takshak (serpent races).
The horse of the sun, liberated preparatory to sacrifice, by the father of
Rama, was seized by the Takshak Ananta; and Janamejaya, king of Delhi,
grandson of Pandu, was killed by one of the same race. In both instances
the Takshak is literally rendered the <em>snake</em>. The successor of Janamejaya
carried war into the seats of this Tak or serpent race, and is said to have
sacrificed 20,000 of them in revenge; but although it is specifically stated
that he subsequently compelled them to sign tributary engagements
(<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>paenama</em></span>), the Brahmans have nevertheless distorted a plain historical
fact by a literal and puerile interpretation. The Paraitakai (<em>Mountain-Tak</em>)
of Alexander were doubtless of this race, as was his ally Taxiles, which
appellation was titular, as he was called Omphis till his father’s death.
It is even probable that this name is the Greek Ὄφις, in which they recognized
the tribe of the Tak or Snake. Taxiles may be compounded of is,
‘lord or chief,’ <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>sila</em></span>, ‘rock or mountain,’ and Tak, ‘lord of the mountain
Tak,’ whose capital was in the range west of the Indus. We are indebted
to the Emperor Babur for the exact position of the capital of this celebrated
race, which he passed in his route of conquest. We have, however, an
intermediate notice of it between Alexander and Babur, in the early history
of the Yadu Bhatti, who came in conflict with the Taks on their expulsion
from Zabulistan and settlement in the Panjab. [The Paraitakai or Paraitakenai
have no connexion with Tāk or Takshak, the first part of the
name perhaps representing Skt. <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>parvata</em></span>, ‘a mountain,’ or <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>pahār</em></span> in the
modern dialect. They lived in the hill country between the rivers Oxus
and Jaxartes (McCrindle, <cite>Alexander</cite>, 57). Omphis represents the Āmbhi,
king of Taxila, a name supposed to mean ‘rock of the Tāk tribe’ (<em>ibid.</em> 413;
Smith, <cite>EHI</cite>, 60), or, more probably, ‘city of cut stone.’]</p>

The hieroglyphics at Turin represent him with the head of an ibis, or eagle,
with an altar before him, on which a shade places his offerings, namely, a
goose, cakes of bread, and flowers of the lotus, and awaits in humble attitude
his doom. In Sanskrit the same word means <em>soul</em>, <em>goose</em>, and <em>swan</em> [?], and
the Hindu poet is always punning upon it; though it might be deemed a
levity to represent the immaterial portion under so unclassical an emblem.
The lotus flowers are alike sacred to the Kan of the Egyptians as to Kanhaiya
the mediator of the Hindus, and both are painted blue and bird-headed.
The claims of Kanhaiya (contracted Kan) as the sun divinity of the Hindus
will be abundantly illustrated in the account of the festivals. [The above

“who regard all Asia, as far as India, as a country sacred to Dionysus
(Bacchus), attribute to that country the invention of nearly all the science
of music. We perceive them sometimes describing the cithara of the
Asiatic, and sometimes applying to flutes the epithet of Phrygian. The
names of certain instruments, such as the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>nabla</em></span>, and others likewise, are
taken from barbarous tongues.” This <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>nabla</em></span> of Strabo is possibly the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>tabla</em></span>,

at a period when even Greece was little removed from barbarism. The
inspirations of the bards of the first ages were all set to music; and the

lest bribery might entice the priests to fix them elsewhere, which would
have involved their loss of sanctity, dignity, and prosperity. It cost me

<h3 class='c024'>CHAPTER 21</h3>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Importance of Mythology.</h4>—It has been observed by that
philosophical traveller, Dr. Clarke, that, “by a proper attention
to the vestiges of ancient superstition, we are sometimes enabled
to refer a whole people to their original ancestors, with as much,
if not more certainty, than by observations made upon their
language; because the superstition is engrafted upon the stock,
but the language is liable to change.”<a id='r4.21.1' /><a href='#f4.21.1' class='c013'><sup>[1]</sup></a> Impressed with the
justness, as well as the originality of the remark, I shall adopt
it as my guide in the observations I propose to make on the
religious festivals and superstitions of Mewar. However important
may be the study of military, civil, and political history,
the science is incomplete without mythological history; and he
is little imbued with the spirit of philosophy who can perceive
in the fables of antiquity nothing but the extravagance of a
fervid imagination. Did no other consequence result from the
study of mythology than the fact that, in all ages and countries,
man has desecrated his reason, and voluntarily reduced himself
below the level of the brutes that perish, it must provoke inquiry
into the cause of this degradation. Such an investigation would
develop, not only the source of history, the handmaid of the arts
and sciences, but the origin and application of the latter, in a theogony
typical of the seasons, their changes, and products. Thus
mythology may be considered the parent of all history.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Aboriginal Tribes.</h4>—With regard, however, to the rude
tribes who still inhabit the mountains and fastnesses of India,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_651'>651</span>and who may be regarded as the aborigines of that country, the
converse of this doctrine is more probable. Not their language
only, but [558] their superstitions, differ from those of the Rajputs:
though, from a desire to rise above their natural condition, they
have engrafted upon their own the most popular mythologies of
their civilized conquerors, who from the north gradually spread
themselves over the continent and peninsula, even to the remote
isles of the Indian Ocean. Of the primitive inhabitants we may
enumerate the Minas, the Meras, the Gonds, the Bhils, the
Sahariyas, the Savaras, the Abhiras, the Gujars, and those who
inhabit the forests of the Nerbudda, the Son, the Mahanadi,
the mountains of Sarguja, and the lesser Nagpur; many of whom
are still but little removed from savage life, and whose dialects
are as various as their manners. These are content to be called
the ‘sons of the earth,’<a id='r4.21.2' /><a href='#f4.21.2' class='c013'><sup>[2]</sup></a> or ‘children of the forest,’<a id='r4.21.3' /><a href='#f4.21.3' class='c013'><sup>[3]</sup></a> while their
conquerors, the Rajputs, arrogate celestial descent.<a id='r4.21.4' /><a href='#f4.21.4' class='c013'><sup>[4]</sup></a> How soon
after the flood the Suryas, or sun-worshippers, entered India
Proper, must ever remain uncertain.<a id='r4.21.5' /><a href='#f4.21.5' class='c013'><sup>[5]</sup></a> It is sufficient that they
were anterior in date to the Indus, or races tracing their descent
from the moon (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>Ind</em></span>); as the migration of the latter from the
central lands of Indo-Scythia was antecedent to that of the
Agnikulas, or fire-worshippers, of the Snake race, claiming
Takshak as their original progenitor. The Suryas,<a id='r4.21.6' /><a href='#f4.21.6' class='c013'><sup>[6]</sup></a> who migrated
both to the East and West, as population became redundant in
these fertile regions, may be considered the Celtic, as the Indu-Getae
may be accounted the Gothic, races of India.<a id='r4.21.7' /><a href='#f4.21.7' class='c013'><sup>[7]</sup></a> To attempt
to discriminate these different races, and mark the shades which
once separated them, after a system of priestcraft has amalgamated
the mass, and identified their superstitions, would be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_652'>652</span>fruitless; but the observer of ancient customs may, with the
imperfect guidance of peculiar rites, discover things, and even
names, totally incongruous with the Brahmanical system, and
which could never have originated within the Indus or Atak,—the
Rubicon of Gangetic antiquaries, who fear to look beyond
that stream for the origin of tribes. A residence amongst the
Rajputs would lead to a disregard of such boundaries, either to
the moral or physical man, as the annals of Mewar abundantly
testify.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Comparative Study of Festivals.</h4>—Sir Wm. Jones remarks,
“If the festivals of the old Greeks, Persians, Romans [559],
Egyptians, and Goths could be arranged with exactness in the
same form with the Indian, there would be found a striking
resemblance among them; and an attentive comparison of them
all might throw great light on the religion, and perhaps on the
history, of the primitive world.”</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Analogies to Rājput Customs in Northern Europe.</h4>—In treating
of the festivals and superstitions of the Rajputs, wherever there
may appear to be a fair ground for supposing an analogy with
those of other nations of antiquity, I shall not hesitate to pursue
it. The proper names of many of the martial Rajputs would
alone point out the necessity of seeking for a solution of them
out of the explored paths; and where Sanskrit derivation cannot
be assigned, as it happens in many instances, we are not, therefore,
warranted in the hasty conclusion that the names must
have been adopted since the conquests of Mahmud or Shihabu-d-din,
events of comparatively modern date. Let us at once admit
the hypothesis of Pinkerton,—the establishment of an original
Indu-Getic or Indo-Scythic empire, “extending from the Caspian
to the Ganges”; or if this conjecture be too extensive or too
vague, let us fix the centre of this Madhya-Bhumi in the fertile
region of Sogdiana;<a id='r4.21.8' /><a href='#f4.21.8' class='c013'><sup>[8]</sup></a> and from the lights which modern history
affords on the many migrations from this nursery of mankind,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_653'>653</span>even since the time of Muhammad, let us form an opinion of those
which have not been recorded, or have been conveyed by the
Hindus only in imperfect allegory; and with the aid of ancient
customs, obsolete words, and proper names, trace them to Indo-Scythic
colonies grafted on the parent stock. The Puranas
themselves bear testimony to the incorporation of Scythic tribes
with the Hindus, and to the continual irruptions of the Saka,
the Pahlavas, the Yavanas,<a id='r4.21.9' /><a href='#f4.21.9' class='c013'><sup>[9]</sup></a> the Turushkas, names conspicuous
amongst the races of Central Asia, and recorded in the pages of
the earliest Western historians. Even so early as the period of
Rama, when furious international wars were carried on between
the military and sacerdotal classes for supremacy, we have the
names of these tribes recorded as auxiliaries [560] to the priesthood;
who, while admitting them to fight under the banners of
Siva, would not scruple to stamp them with the seal of Hinduism.
In this manner, beyond a doubt, at a much later period than the
events in the Ramayana, these tribes from the North either forced
themselves among, or were incorporated with, ‘the races of the
sun.’ When, therefore, we meet with rites in Rajputana and in
ancient Scandinavia, such as were practised amongst the Getic
nations on the Oxus, why should we hesitate to assign the origin
of both to this region of earliest civilization? When we see
the ancient Asii, and the Iutae, or Jutes, taking omens from the
white steed of Thor, shut up in the temple at Upsala; and in like
manner, the Rajput of past days offering the same animal in
sacrifice to the sun, and his modern descendant taking the omen
from his neigh, why are we to refuse our assent to the common
origin of the superstition practised by the Getae of the Oxus?
Again, when we find the ‘homage to the sword’ performed by
all the Getic races of antiquity in Dacia, on the Baltic, as well as
by the modern Rajput, shall we draw no conclusion from this
testimony of the father of history, who declares that such rites
<span class='pageno' id='Page_654'>654</span>were practised on the Jaxartes in the very dawn of knowledge?<a id='r4.21.10' /><a href='#f4.21.10' class='c013'><sup>[10]</sup></a>
Moreover, why hesitate to give Eastern etymologies for Eastern
rites, though found on the Baltic? The antiquary of the
North (Mallet) may thus be assisted to the etymon of ‘Tir-sing,’
the enchanted sword of Angantýr, in <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>tir</em></span>, ‘water,’ and <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>singh</em></span>,
‘a lion’; <em>i.e.</em> in water or spirit like a lion; for even <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>pani</em></span>,
the common epithet for water, is applied metaphorically to
‘spirit.’<a id='r4.21.11' /><a href='#f4.21.11' class='c013'><sup>[11]</sup></a></div>

<p class='c001'>It would be less difficult to find Sanskrit derivations for many
of the proper names in the Edda, than to give a Sanskrit analysis
of many common amongst the Rajputs, which we must trace to
an Indo-Scythic root:<a id='r4.21.12' /><a href='#f4.21.12' class='c013'><sup>[12]</sup></a> such as Eyvorsél, Udila, Attitai, Pujun,
Hamira,<a id='r4.21.13' /><a href='#f4.21.13' class='c013'><sup>[13]</sup></a> and numerous other proper names of warriors. Of
tribes: the Kathi, Rajpali, Mohila, Sariaspah, Aswaria (<em>qu.</em>
Assyrian?), Banaphar, Kamari, Silara, Dahima, etc. Of mountains:
Drinodhar, Arbuda, Aravalli, Aravindha (the root <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>ara</em></span>,
or mountain, being Scythic, and the expletive adjunct Sanskrit),
‘the hill of Budha,’ ‘of strength,’ ‘of limit.’ To all such as
cannot be [561] resolved into the cognate language of India, what
origin can we assign but Scythic?<a id='r4.21.14' /><a href='#f4.21.14' class='c013'><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Festivals in Mewār. Naurātri Festival.</h4>—In a memoir prepared
for me by a well-informed public officer in the Rana’s court, on
the chief festivals celebrated in Mewar, he commenced with those
following the autumnal equinox, in the month Asoj or Aswini,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_655'>655</span>opening with the Nauratri, sacred to the god of war. Their fasts
are in general regulated by the moon; although the most remarkable
are solar, especially those of the equinoxes and solstices, and
the Sankrantis, or days on which the sun enters a new sign. The
Hindu solar year anciently commenced on the winter solstice,
in the month Pausha, and was emphatically called ‘the morning
of the gods’; also Sivaratri, or night of Siva, analogous, as has
been before remarked, to the ‘mother night,’ which ushered in
the new year of the Scandinavian Asi, and other nations of Asiatic
origin dwelling in the north.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Repose of Vishnu.</h4>—They term the summer solstice in the
month of Asarh, ‘the night of the gods,’ because Vishnu (as the
sun) reposes during the four rainy months on his serpent couch.
The lunar year of 360 days was more ancient than the solar, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_656'>656</span>commenced with the month of Asoj or Aswini: “the moon being
at the full when that name was imposed on the first lunar station
of the Hindu ecliptic.”<a id='r4.21.15' /><a href='#f4.21.15' class='c013'><sup>[15]</sup></a></div>

<p class='c001'>According to another authority, the festivals commenced on
Amavas, or the Ides of Chait, near which the vernal equinox falls,
the opening of the modern solar year; when, in like manner as
at the commencement of the lunar year in Asoj, they [562]
dedicate the first nine days of Chait (also called Nauratri) to
Iswara and his consort Isani.</p>

<p class='c001'>Having thus specified both modes of reckoning for the opening
of the solar and lunar years, I shall not commence the abstract
of the festivals of Mewar with either, but follow the more ancient
division of time, when the year closed with the winter solstice
in the month of Pus, consequently opening the new year with
Magh. By this arrangement, we shall commence with the spring
festivals, and let the days dedicated to mirth and gaiety follow
each other; preferring the natural to the astrological year,
which will enable us to preserve the analogy with the northern
nations of Europe, who also reckoned from the winter solstice.
The Hindu divides the year into six seasons, each of two months;
namely, Vasanta, Grishma, Varsha, Sarad, Sisira, Sita; or spring,
summer, rainy, sultry, dewy, and cold.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is not, however, my intention to detail all the fasts and
festivals which the Rajput of Mewar holds in common with the
Hindu nation, but chiefly those restricted to that State, or such
as are celebrated with local peculiarity, or striking analogies to
those of Egypt, Greece, or Scandinavia. The goddess who presides
over mirth and idleness preferred holding her court amidst
the ruins of Udaipur to searching elsewhere for a dwelling. This
determination to be happy amidst calamity, individual and
national, has made the court proverbial in Rajwara, in the adage,
‘<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>sat bara, aur nau teohara</em></span>,’ <em>i.e.</em> nine holidays out of seven days.
Although many of these festivals are common to India, and their
maintenance is enjoined by religion, yet not only the prolongation
and repetition of some, but the entire institution of others, as
well as the peculiar splendour of their solemnization, originate
with the prince; proving how much individual example may

<div class='section-start'><span class='pageno' id='Page_657'>657</span><h4 class='disp-inline'>Spring Festival, Vasant Panchami.</h4>—By the arrangement we
have adopted, the lovely Vasanti, goddess of the spring, will
usher in the festivals of Mewar. In 1819 her rites were celebrated
in the kalends of January, and even then, on the verge of the
tropic, her birth was premature.</div>

<p class='c001'>The opening of the spring being on the 5th of the month
Magha, is thence called the Vasant panchami, which in 1819 fell on
the 30th of January; consequently the first of Pus (the antecedent
month), the beginning of the old Hindu [563] year, or ‘the
morning of the gods,’ fell on the 25th of December. The Vasant
continues forty days after the panchami, or initiative fifth, during
which the utmost license prevails in action and in speech; the
lower classes regale even to intoxication on every kind of stimulating
confection and spirituous beverage, and the most respectable
individuals, who would at other times be shocked to utter
an indelicate allusion, roam about with the groups of bacchanals,
reciting stanzas of the warmest description in praise of the powers
of nature, as did the conscript fathers of Rome during the Saturnalia.
In this season, when the barriers of rank are thrown
down, and the spirit of democracy is let loose, though never
abused, even the wild Bhil, or savage Mer, will leave his forest or
mountain shade to mingle in the revelries of the capital; and
decorating his ebon hair or tattered turban with a garland of
jessamine, will join the clamorous parties which perambulate the
streets of the capital. These orgies are, however, reserved for the
conclusion of the forty days sacred to the goddess of nature.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Bhān Saptami Festival.</h4>—Two days following the initiative
fifth is the Bhan saptami or ‘seventh [day] of the sun,’ also
called ‘the birth of the sun,’ with various other metaphorical
denominations.<a id='r4.21.16' /><a href='#f4.21.16' class='c013'><sup>[16]</sup></a> On this day there is a grand procession of the
Rana, his chiefs and vassals, to the Chaugan, where the sun is
worshipped. At the Jaipur court, whose princes claim descent
from Kusa, the second son of Rama, the Bhan saptami is peculiarly
sacred. The chariot of the sun, drawn by eight horses, is taken
from the temple dedicated to that orb, and moved in procession:
a ceremony otherwise never observed but on the inauguration of
a new prince.</div>

<div class='section-start'><span class='pageno' id='Page_658'>658</span><h4 class='disp-inline'>Sun Worship.</h4>—In the mythology of the Rajputs, of which we
have a better idea from their heroic poetry than from the legends
of the Brahmans, the sun-god is the deity they are most anxious
to propitiate; and in his honour they fearlessly expend their
blood in battle, from the hope of being received into his mansion.
Their highest heaven is accordingly the Bhanuthan or Bhanuloka,
the ‘region of the sun’: and like the Indu-Scythic Getae, the
Rajput warrior of the early ages sacrificed the horse in his honour,<a id='r4.21.17' /><a href='#f4.21.17' class='c013'><sup>[17]</sup></a>
and dedicated to him the first day of the week, namely, Adityawar,
contracted to Itwar, also called Thawara<a id='r4.21.18' /><a href='#f4.21.18' class='c013'><sup>[18]</sup></a> [564].</div>

<p class='c001'>The more we attend to the warlike mythology of the north,
the more apparent is its analogy with that of the Rajputs, and
the stronger ground is there for assuming that both races inherited
their creed from the common land of the Yuti of the
Jaxartes. What is a more proper etymon for Scandinavian, the
abode of the warriors who destroyed the Roman power, than
Skanda, the Mars or Kumara of the Rajputs? perhaps the origin
of the Cimbri, derived by Mallet from koempfer, ‘to fight.’</p>

<p class='c001'>Thor, in the eleventh fable of the Edda, is denominated Asa-Thor,<a id='r4.21.19' /><a href='#f4.21.19' class='c013'><sup>[19]</sup></a>
the ‘lord Thor,’ called the Celtic Mars by the Romans.
The chariot of Thor is ignobly yoked compared with the car of
Surya; but in the substitution of the he-goats for the seven-headed
horse Saptasva we have but the change of an adjunct
depending on clime, when the Yuti migrated from the plains of
Scythia, of which the horse is a native, to Yutland, of whose
mountains the goat was an inhabitant prior to any of the race of
Asi. The northern warrior makes the palace of the sun-god
Thor the most splendid of the celestial abodes, “in which are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_659'>659</span>five hundred and forty halls”: vying with the Suryamandala,
the supreme heaven of the Rajput. Whence such notions of the
Aswa races of the Ganges, and the Asi of Scandinavia, but from
the Scythic Saka, who adored the solar divinity under the name
of ‘Gaeto-Syrus,’<a id='r4.21.20' /><a href='#f4.21.20' class='c013'><sup>[20]</sup></a> the Surya of the Sachha Rajput; and as,
according to the commentator on the Edda, “the ancient people
of the north pronounced the <em>th</em> as the English now do <em>ss</em>,” the
sun-god <em>Thor</em> becomes <em>Sor</em>, and is identified still more with Surya
whose worship no doubt gave the name to that extensive portion
of Asia called Συρία, as it did to the small peninsula of the Sauras,
still peopled by tribes of Scythic origin. The Sol of the Romans
has probably the same Celto-Etrurian origin; with those tribes
the sun was the great object of adoration, and their grand festival,
the winter solstice, was called Yule, Hiul, Houl, “which even at
this day signifies the Sun, in the language of Bas-Bretagne and
Cornwall.”<a id='r4.21.21' /><a href='#f4.21.21' class='c013'><sup>[21]</sup></a> On the conversion of the descendants of these
Scythic Yeuts, who, according to [565] Herodotus, sacrificed the
horse (<em>Hi</em>) to the sun (<em>El</em>), the name of the Pagan jubilee of the
solstice was transferred to the day of Christ’s nativity, which
is thus still held in remembrance by their descendants of the
north.<a id='r4.21.22' /><a href='#f4.21.22' class='c013'><sup>[22]</sup></a></p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Sun Worship at Udaipur.</h4>—At Udaipur the sun has universal
precedence; his portal (<span lang="sa" xml:lang="sa"><em>Suryapol</em></span>) is the chief entrance to the
city; his name gives dignity to the chief apartment or hall
(<span lang="sa" xml:lang="sa"><em>Suryamahall</em></span>) of the palace; and from the balcony of the sun
(<span lang="sa" xml:lang="sa"><em>Suryagokhra</em></span>) the descendant of Rama shows himself in the dark
monsoon as the sun’s representative. A huge painted sun of
gypsum in high relief, with gilded rays, adorns the hall of audience,
and in front of it is the throne. As already mentioned, the sacred
standard bears his image,<a id='r4.21.23' /><a href='#f4.21.23' class='c013'><sup>[23]</sup></a> as does that Scythic part of the regalia
called the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>changi</em></span>, a disc of black felt or ostrich feathers, with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_660'>660</span>plate of gold to represent the sun in its centre, borne upon a pole.
The royal parasol is termed <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>kirania</em></span>, in allusion to its shape, like
a ray (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>kiran</em></span>) of the orb. The last day but one of the month of
Magha is called Sivaratri (night of Siva), and is held peculiarly
sacred by the Rana, who is styled the Regent of Siva. It is a
rigid fast, and the night is passed in vigils, and rites to the phallic
representative of Siva.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Spring Hunt.</h4>—The merry month of Phalgun is ushered
in with the Aheria, or spring-hunt.<a id='r4.21.24' /><a href='#f4.21.24' class='c013'><sup>[24]</sup></a> The preceding day the Rana
distributes to all his chiefs and servants either a dress of green,
or some portion thereof, in which all appear habited on the
morrow, whenever the astrologer has fixed the hour for sallying
forth to slay the boar to Gauri, the Ceres of the Rajputs: the
Aheria is therefore called the Mahurat ka shikar, or the chase
fixed astrologically. As their success on this occasion is ominous
of future good, no means are neglected to secure it, either by
scouts previously discovering the lair, or the desperate efforts of
the hunters to slay the boar when roused. With the sovereign
and his sons all the chiefs sally forth, each on his best steed, and
all animated by the desire to surpass each other in acts of prowess
and dexterity. It is very rare that in some one of the passes or
recesses of the valley the hog is not found; the spot is then
surrounded by the [566] hunters, whose vociferations soon start
the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>dukkara</em></span>,<a id='r4.21.25' /><a href='#f4.21.25' class='c013'><sup>[25]</sup></a> and frequently a drove of hogs. Then each cavalier
impels his steed, and with lance or sword, regardless of rock,
ravine, or tree, presses on the bristly foe, whose knowledge of the
country is of no avail when thus circumvented, and the ground
soon reeks with gore, in which not unfrequently is mixed that of
horse or rider. On the last occasion there occurred fewer casualties
than usual; though the Chondawat Hamira, whom we
nicknamed the ‘Red Riever,’ had his leg broken, and the second
<span class='pageno' id='Page_661'>661</span>son of Sheodan Singh, a near relation of the Rana, had his neighbour’s
lance driven through his arm. The young chief of Salumbar
was amongst the distinguished of this day’s sport. It would
appal even an English fox-hunter to see the Rajputs driving their
steeds at full speed, bounding like the antelope over every barrier—the
thick jungle covert, or rocky steep bare of soil or vegetation,—with
their lances balanced in the air, or leaning on the
saddle-bow slashing at the boar.</div>

<p class='c001'>The royal kitchen moves out on this occasion, and in some
chosen spot the repast is prepared, of which all partake, for the
hog is the favourite food of the Rajput, as it was of the heroes
of Scandinavia. Nor is the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>munawwar piyala</em></span>, or invitation cup,
forgotten; and having feasted, and thrice slain their bristly
antagonist, they return to the capital, where fame had already
spread their exploits—the deeds done by the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>barchhi</em></span> (lance) of
Padma,<a id='r4.21.26' /><a href='#f4.21.26' class='c013'><sup>[26]</sup></a> or the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>khanda</em></span> (sword) blow of Hamira,<a id='r4.21.27' /><a href='#f4.21.27' class='c013'><sup>[27]</sup></a> which lopped
the head of the foe of Gauri. Even this martial amusement, the
Aheria, has a religious origin. The boar is the enemy of Gauri of
the Rajputs; it was so held of Isis by the Egyptians, of Ceres by
the Greeks, of Freya by the north-man, whose favourite food was
the hog: and of such importance was it deemed by the Franks,
that the second chapter of the Salic law is entirely penal with
regard to the stealers of swine. The heroes of the Edda, even in
Valhalla, feed on the fat of the wild boar Saehrimner, while “the
illustrious father of armies fattens his wolves Geri and Freki, and
takes no other nourishment himself than the interrupted quaffing
of wine”: quite the picture of Har, the Rajput god of war, and
his sons the Bhairavas, Krodha, and Kala, metaphorically called
the ‘sons of slaughter.’ We need hardly repeat that the cup
of the Scandinavian god of war, like that of the Rajputs, is the
human skull (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>khopra</em></span>) [567].<a id='r4.21.28' /><a href='#f4.21.28' class='c013'><sup>[28]</sup></a></p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Phāg or Holi Festival.</h4>—As Phalgun advances, the bacchanalian
mirth increases; groups are continually patrolling the
streets, throwing a crimson powder at each other, or ejecting a
solution of it from syringes, so that the garments and visages of
all are one mass of crimson. On the 8th, emphatically called
<span class='pageno' id='Page_662'>662</span>the Phag, the Rana joins the queens and their attendants in the
palace, when all restraint is removed and mirth is unlimited.
But the most brilliant sight is the playing of the Holi on horseback,
on the terrace in front of the palace. Each chief who chooses to
join has a plentiful supply of missiles, formed of thin plates of
mica or talc, enclosing this crimson powder, called <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>abira</em></span>, which
with the most graceful and dextrous horsemanship they dart at
each other, pursuing, caprioling, and jesting. This part of it
much resembles the Saturnalia of Rome of this day, when similar
missiles are scattered at the Carnivâle. The last day or Punon
ends the Holi, when the Nakkaras from the Tripolia summon all
the chiefs with their retinues to attend their prince, and accompany
him in procession to the Chaugan, their Champ de Mars.
In the centre of this is a long <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>sala</em></span> or hall, the ascent to which is
by a flight of steps: the roof is supported by square columns
without any walls, so that the court is entirely open. Here,
surrounded by his chiefs, the Rana passes an hour, listening to
the songs in praise of Holika, while a scurrilous <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>kavya</em></span> or couplet
from some wag in the crowd reminds him, that exalted rank is
no protection against the license of the spring Saturnalia; though
‘the Diwan of Eklinga’ has not to reproach himself with a
failure of obedience to the rites of the goddess, having fulfilled
the command ‘to multiply,’ more than any individual in his
kingdom.<a id='r4.21.29' /><a href='#f4.21.29' class='c013'><sup>[29]</sup></a> While the Rana and his chiefs are thus amused above,
the buffoons and itinerant groups mix with the cavalcade, throw
powder in their eyes, or deluge their garments with the crimson
solution. To resent it would only expose the sensitive party to
be laughed at, and draw upon him a host of these bacchanals: so
that no alternative exists between keeping entirely aloof or
mixing in the fray [568].<a id='r4.21.30' /><a href='#f4.21.30' class='c013'><sup>[30]</sup></a></div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_663'>663</span>On the last day, the Rana feasts his chiefs, and the camp
breaks up with the distribution of <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>khanda nariyal</em></span>, or swords and
coco-nuts, to the chiefs and all “whom the king delighteth to
honour.” These <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>khandas</em></span> are but ‘of lath,’ in shape like the
Andrea Ferrara, or long cut-and-thrust, the favourite weapon
of the Rajput. They are painted in various ways, like Harlequin’s
sword, and meant as a burlesque, in unison with the character
of the day, when war is banished, and the multiplication,<a id='r4.21.31' /><a href='#f4.21.31' class='c013'><sup>[31]</sup></a> not
the destruction, of man is the behest of the goddess who rules the
spring. At nightfall, the forty days conclude with ‘the burning
of the Holi,’ when they light large fires, into which various
substances, as well as the crimson <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>abira</em></span>, are thrown, and around
which groups of children are dancing and screaming in the streets
like so many infernals. Until three hours after sunrise of the
new month of Chait, these orgies are continued with increased
vigour, when the natives bathe, change their garments, worship,
and return to the rank of sober citizens; and princes and chiefs
receive gifts from their domestics.<a id='r4.21.32' /><a href='#f4.21.32' class='c013'><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Chait.</h4>—The first of this month is the Samvatsara (vulg.
Chamchari), or anniversary of the death of the Rana’s father, to
whose memory solemn rites are performed both in the palace and
at Ara, the royal cemetery, metaphorically termed Mahasati, or
place of ‘great faith.’ Thither the Rana repairs, and offers
oblations to the <em>manes</em> of his father; and after purifying in the
Gangabheva, a rivulet which flows through the middle of ‘the
abode of silence,’ he returns to the palace.</div>

<p class='c001'>On the 3rd, the whole of the royal insignia proceeds to Bedla,
the residence of the Chauhan chief (one of the Sixteen), within
the valley of the capital, in order to convey the Rao to court.
The Rana advances to the Ganesa Deori<a id='r4.21.33' /><a href='#f4.21.33' class='c013'><sup>[33]</sup></a> to receive him; when,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_664'>664</span>after salutation, the sovereign and his chief return to the great
hall of assembly, hand in hand, but that of the Chauhan above
or upon his sovereign’s. In this ceremony we have another
singular memorial of the glorious days of Mewar, when almost
every chieftain established by deeds of devotion a right to the
eternal gratitude of their princes; the decay of whose [569]
power but serves to hallow such reminiscences. It is in these
little acts of courteous condescension, deviations from the formal
routine of reception, that we recognize the traces of Rajput
history; for inquiry into these customs will reveal the incident
which gave birth to each, and curiosity will be amply repaid, in a
lesson at once of political and moral import. For my own part,
I never heard the kettledrum of my friend Raj Kalyan strike at
the sacred barrier, the Tripolia, without recalling the glorious

sires.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Sītala’s Festival.</h4>—Chait badi sat, or ‘7th of [the dark fortnight]
Chait,’ is in honour of the goddess Sitala, the protectress
of children: all the matrons of the city proceed with their
offerings to the shrine of the goddess, placed upon the very
pinnacle of an isolated hill in the valley. In every point of
view, this divinity is the twin-sister of the Mater Montana,<a id='r4.21.36' /><a href='#f4.21.36' class='c013'><sup>[36]</sup></a> the

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Birthday of the Rana.</h4>—This is also the Rana’s birthday,<a id='r4.21.37' /><a href='#f4.21.37' class='c013'><sup>[37]</sup></a> on
which occasion all classes flock with gifts and good wishes that
“the king may live for ever”; but it is in the penetralia of the
Rawala, where the profane eye enters not, that the greatest

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>New Year’s Day. The Festival of Flowers.</h4>—Chait Sudi 1st (15th
of the month) is the opening of the luni-solar year of Vikramaditya.
Ceremonies, which more especially appertain to the Nauratri of
Asoj, are performed on this day; and the sword is worshipped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_665'>665</span>in the palace. But such rites are subordinate to those of the fair
divinity, who still rules over this the smiling portion of the year.
Vasanti has ripened into the fragrant Flora, and all the fair of
the capital, as well as the other sex, repair to the gardens and
groves, where parties assemble, regale, and swing, adorned with
chaplets of roses, jessamine, or oleander, when the Naulakha
gardens may vie with the Tivoli of Paris. They return in the
evening to the city.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Festival of Flowers.</h4>—The Rajput Floralia ushers in the
rites of the beneficent Gauri, which continue nine days, the
number sacred to the creative [570] power. These vie with
the Cerealia of Rome, or the more ancient rites of the goddess
of the Nile: I shall therefore devote some space to a particular
account of them.<a id='r4.21.38' /><a href='#f4.21.38' class='c013'><sup>[38]</sup></a></div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Ganggor Festival.</h4>—Among the many remarkable festivals of
Rajasthan, kept with peculiar brilliancy at Udaipur, is that in
honour of Gauri, or Isani, the goddess of abundance, the Isis of
Egypt, the Ceres of Greece. Like the Rajput Saturnalia, which
it follows, it belongs to the vernal equinox, when nature in
these regions proximate to the tropic is in the full expanse of her
charms, and the matronly Gauri casts her golden mantle over
the beauties of the verdant Vasanti.<a id='r4.21.39' /><a href='#f4.21.39' class='c013'><sup>[39]</sup></a> Then the fruits exhibit
their promise to the eye; the koil fills the ear with melody; the
air is impregnated with aroma, and the crimson poppy contrasts
with the spikes of golden grain, to form a wreath for the beneficent
Gauri.</div>

<p class='c001'>Gauri is one of the names of Isa or Parvati, wife of the greatest
of the gods, Mahadeva or Iswara, who is conjoined with her in
these rites, which almost exclusively appertain to the women.
The meaning of Gauri is ‘yellow,’ emblematic of the ripened
harvest, when the votaries of the goddess adore her effigies, which
are those of a matron painted the colour of ripe corn; and though
her image is represented with only two hands, in one of which
she holds the lotos, which the Egyptians regarded as emblematic
of reproduction, yet not unfrequently they equip her with the
warlike conch, the discus, and the club, to denote that the goddess,
whose gifts sustain life, is likewise accessary to the loss of it:
uniting, as Gauri and Kali, the characters of life and death, like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_666'>666</span>the Isis and Cybele of the Egyptians. But here she is only seen
as Annapurna, the benefactress of mankind. The rites commence
when the sun enters Aries (the opening of the Hindu year), by a
deputation to a spot beyond the city, “to bring earth for the
image of Gauri.”<a id='r4.21.40' /><a href='#f4.21.40' class='c013'><sup>[40]</sup></a> When this is formed, a smaller one of Iswara
is made, and they are placed together; a small trench is then
excavated, in which barley is sown; the ground is irrigated and
artificial heat supplied till the grain germinates, when the females
join hands and dance round it, invoking the blessings of Gauri on
their husbands.<a id='r4.21.41' /><a href='#f4.21.41' class='c013'><sup>[41]</sup></a> The young corn is then taken up, distributed,
and presented by the females to the men, who wear it in their
turbans. Every wealthy family has its image, or at least every
purwa or subdivision of the city. These and other [571] rites
known only to the initiated having been performed for several
days within doors, they decorate the images, and prepare to
carry them in procession to the lake. During these days of
preparation, nothing is talked of but Gauri’s departure from the
palace; whether she will be as sumptuously apparelled as in the
year gone by; whether an additional boat will be launched on
the occasion; though not a few forget the goddess altogether
in the recollection of the gazelle eyes (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>mrig-nayani</em></span>) and serpentine
locks (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>nagini-zulf</em></span>)<a id='r4.21.42' /><a href='#f4.21.42' class='c013'><sup>[42]</sup></a> of the beauteous handmaids who are
selected to attend her. At length the hour arrives, the martial
nakkaras give the signal “to the cannonier without,” and speculation
is at rest when the guns on the summit of the castle of
Eklinggarh announce that Gauri has commenced her excursion
to the lake.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Bathing of the Goddess.</h4>—The cavalcade assembles on
the magnificent terrace, and the Rana, surrounded by his nobles,
leads the way to the boats, of a form as primitive as that which
conveyed the Argonauts to Colchis. The scenery is admirably
adapted for these fêtes, the ascent being gradual from the margin
of the lake, which here forms a fine bay, and gently rising to the
crest of the ridge on which the palace and dwellings of the chiefs
are built. Every turret and balcony is crowded with spectators,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_667'>667</span>from the palace to the water’s edge; and the ample flight of
marble steps which intervene from the Tripolia, or triple portal,
to the boats, is a dense mass of females in variegated robes, whose
scarfs but half conceal their ebon tresses adorned with the rose
and the jessamine. A more imposing or more exhilarating sight
cannot be imagined than the entire population of a city thus
assembled for the purpose of rejoicing; the countenance of
every individual, from the prince to the peasant, dressed in
smiles. Carry the eye to heaven, and it rests on ‘a sky without
a cloud’: below is a magnificent lake, the even surface of the
deep blue waters broken only by palaces of marble, whose arched
piazzas are seen through the foliage of orange groves, plantain,
and tamarind; while the vision is bounded by noble mountains,
their peaks towering over each other, and composing an immense
amphitheatre. Here the deformity of vice intrudes not; no
object is degraded by inebriation: no tumultuous disorder or
deafening clamour, but all await patiently, with eyes directed
to the Tripolia, the appearance of Gauri. At length the procession
is seen winding down the steep, and in the midst [572], borne on a
<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>pat</em></span>,<a id='r4.21.43' /><a href='#f4.21.43' class='c013'><sup>[43]</sup></a> or throne, gorgeously arrayed in yellow robes, and blazing
with ‘barbaric pearl and gold,’ the goddess appears; on either
side the two beauties wave the silver <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>chamara</em></span> over her head,
while the more favoured damsels act as harbingers, preceding
her with wands of silver: the whole chanting hymns. On her
approach, the Rana, his chiefs and ministers rise and remain
standing till the goddess is seated on her throne close to the
water’s edge, when all bow, and the prince and court take their
seats in the boats. The females then form a circle around the
goddess, unite hands, and with a measured step and various
graceful inclinations of the body, keeping time by beating the
palms at particular cadences, move round the image singing
hymns, some in honour of the goddess of abundance, others on
love and chivalry; and embodying little episodes of national
achievements, occasionally sprinkled with <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>double entendre</em></span>, which
excites a smile and significant nod from the chiefs, and an inclination
of the head of the fair choristers. The festival being entirely
female, not a single male mixed in the immense groups, and even
Iswara himself, the husband of Gauri, attracts no attention, as
appears from his ascetic or mendicant form begging his dole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_668'>668</span>from the bounteous and universal mother. It is taken for
granted that the goddess is occupied in bathing all the time
she remains, and ancient tradition says death was the penalty
of any male intruding on these solemnities; but the present
prince deems them so fitted for amusement, that he has even
instituted a second Ganggor. Some hours are thus consumed,
while easy and good-humoured conversation is carried on. At
length, the ablutions over, the goddess is taken up, and conveyed
to the palace with the same forms and state. The Rana and
his chiefs then unmoor their boats, and are rowed round the
margin of the lake, to visit in succession the other images of
the goddess, around which female groups are chanting and
worshipping, as already described, with which ceremonies the
evening closes, when the whole terminates with a grand display
of fireworks, the finale of each of the three days dedicated to
Gauri.</div>

<p class='c001'>Considerable resemblance is to be discerned between this
festival of Gauri and that in honour of the Egyptian Diana<a id='r4.21.44' /><a href='#f4.21.44' class='c013'><sup>[44]</sup></a> at
Bubastis, and Isis at Busiris, within the [573] Delta of the Nile, of
which Herodotus says: “They who celebrate those of Diana
embark in vessels; the women strike their tabors, the men
their flutes; the rest of both sexes clap their hands, and join
in chorus. Whatever city they approach, the vessels are brought
on shore; the women use ungracious language, dance, and indelicately
throw about their garments.”<a id='r4.21.45' /><a href='#f4.21.45' class='c013'><sup>[45]</sup></a> Wherever the rites
of Isis prevailed, we find the boat introduced as an essential
emblem in her worship, whether in the heart of Rajasthan, on
the banks of the Nile, or in the woods of Germany. Bryant<a id='r4.21.46' /><a href='#f4.21.46' class='c013'><sup>[46]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_669'>669</span>furnishes an interesting account from Diodorus and Curtius,
illustrated by drawings from Pocock, from the temple of Luxor,
near Carnac, in the Thebaid, of ‘the ship of Isis,’ carrying an
ark; and from a male figure therein, this learned person thinks
it bears a mysterious allusion to the deluge. I am inclined to
deem the personage in the ark Osiris, husband of Isis, the type of
the sun arrived in the sign of Aries (of which the ram’s heads
ornamenting both the prow and stem of the vessel are typical),
the harbinger of the annual fertilizing inundation of the Nile:
evincing identity of origin as an equinoctial festival with that of
Gauri (Isis) of the Indu-Scythic races of Rajasthan.</p>

<p class='c001'>The German Suevi adored Isis, and also introduced a ship in
her worship, for which Tacitus<a id='r4.21.47' /><a href='#f4.21.47' class='c013'><sup>[47]</sup></a> is at a loss to account, and with
his usual candour says he has no materials whence to investigate
the origin of a worship denoting the foreign origin of the tribe.
This Isis of the Suevi was evidently a form of Ertha, the chief
divinity of all the Saxon races, who, with her consort Teutates
or Hesus<a id='r4.21.48' /><a href='#f4.21.48' class='c013'><sup>[48]</sup></a> (Mercury), were the chief deities of both the Celtic
and early Gothic races: the [574] Budha and Ila of the Rajputs;
in short, the earth,<a id='r4.21.49' /><a href='#f4.21.49' class='c013'><sup>[49]</sup></a> the prolific mother, the Isis of Egypt, the
Ceres of Greece, the Annapurna (giver of food) of the Rajputs.
On some ancient temples dedicated to this Hindu Ceres we have
sculptured on the frieze and pedestal of the columns the emblem
of abundance, termed the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>kamakumbha</em></span>, or vessel of desire, a
vase of elegant form, from which branches of the palm are gracefully
pendent. Herodotus says that similar water-vessels, filled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_670'>670</span>with wheat and barley, were carried in the festival of Isis; and
all who have attended to Egyptian antiquities are aware that the
god Canopus is depicted under the form of a water-jar, or Nilometer,
whose covering bears the head of Osiris.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Agastya Festival.</h4>—To render the analogy perfect between
the vessels emblematic of the Isis of the Nile and the Ganges,
there is a festival sacred to the sage Agastya, who presides over
the star Canopus, when the sun enters Virgo (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>Kanya</em></span>). The
<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>kamakumbha</em></span> is then personified under the epithet <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>kumbhayoni</em></span>,
and the votary is instructed to pour water into a sea-shell, in
which having placed white flowers and unground rice, turning
his face to the south, he offers it with this incantation: “Hail,
Kumbhayoni, born in the sight of Mitra and Varuna (the sun
and water divinities), bright as the blossom of the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>kusa</em></span> (grass),
who sprung from Agni (fire) and the Maruts.” By the prefix
of Ganga (the river) to Gauri, we see that the Ganggor festival
is essentially sacred to a river-goddess, affording additional proof
of the common origin of the rites of the Isis of Egypt and
India.</div>

<p class='c001'>The Egyptians, according to Plutarch, considered the Nile as
flowing from Osiris, in like manner as the Hindu poet describes
the fair Ganga flowing from the head of Iswara, which Sir W.
Jones thus classically paints in his hymn to Ganga:</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Goddess Ganga.</h4>—Ganga, the river-goddess, like the Nile,
is the type of fertility, and like that celebrated stream, has her
source amidst the eternal glaciers of Chandragiri or Somagiri
(the mountains of the moon); the higher peaks of the gigantic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_671'>671</span>Himalaya, where Parvati is represented as ornamenting the
tiara of Iswara “with a beamy moon.” In this metaphor, and
in his title of Somanatha (lord of the moon), we again have
evidence of Iswara, or Siva, after representing the sun, having
the satellite moon as his ornament.<a id='r4.21.50' /><a href='#f4.21.50' class='c013'><sup>[50]</sup></a> His Olympus, Kailasa, is
studded with that majestic pine, the cedar; thence he is called
Kedarnath, ‘lord of the cedar-trees.’<a id='r4.21.51' /><a href='#f4.21.51' class='c013'><sup>[51]</sup></a> The mysteries of Osiris
and those of Eleusis<a id='r4.21.52' /><a href='#f4.21.52' class='c013'><sup>[52]</sup></a> were of the same character, commemorative
of the first germ of civilization, the culture of the earth, under a
variety of names, Ertha, Isis, Diana, Ceres, Ila. It is a curious
fact that in the terra-cotta images of Isis, frequently excavated
about her temple at Paestum,<a id='r4.21.53' /><a href='#f4.21.53' class='c013'><sup>[53]</sup></a> she holds in her right hand an
exact representation of the Hindu lingam and yoni combined;
and on the Indian expedition to Egypt, our Hindu soldiers
deemed themselves amongst the altars of their own god Iswara
(Osiris), from the abundance of his emblematic representatives.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Aghori Ascetics.</h4>—In the festival of Ganggor, as before
mentioned, Iswara yields to his consort Gauri, and occupies an
unimportant position near her at the water’s edge, meanly clad,
smoking intoxicating herbs, and, whether by accident or design,
holding the stalk of an onion in full blossom as a mace or club—a
plant regarded by some of the Egyptians with veneration, and
held by the Hindus generally in detestation: and why they
should on such an occasion thus degrade Iswara, I know not.
Onion-juice is reluctantly taken when prescribed medicinally, as
a powerful stimulant, by those who would reject spirituous
liquors; and there are classes, as the Aghori, that worship
Iswara in his most degraded form, who will not only devour raw
flesh, but that of man; and to whom it is a matter of perfect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_672'>672</span>indifference whether the victim was slaughtered or died a natural
<a id='corr672.2'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='death'>death.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_672.2'><ins class='correction' title='death'>death.</ins></a></span> For the honour of humanity, such monsters are few in
number; but that they practise [576] these deeds I can testify,
from a personal visit to their haunts, where I saw the cave of
one of these Troglodyte monsters, in which by his own command
he was inhumed; and which will remain closed, until curiosity
and incredulity greater than mine may disturb the bones of the
Aghori of Abu.</div>

<p class='c001'>The ὠμοφαγία, or eating raw flesh with the blood, was a part
of the secret mysteries of Osiris, in commemoration of the happy
change in the condition of mankind from savage to civilized life,
and intended to deter by disgust the return thereto.<a id='r4.21.54' /><a href='#f4.21.54' class='c013'><sup>[54]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The Buddhists pursued this idea to excess; and in honour of
Adiswara, the First, who from his abode of Meru taught them
the arts of agriculture, they altogether abandoned that type of
savage life, the eating of the flesh of animals,<a id='r4.21.55' /><a href='#f4.21.55' class='c013'><sup>[55]</sup></a> and confined themselves
to the fruits of the earth. With these sectarian anti-idolaters,
who are almost all of Rajput descent, the beneficent
Lakshmi, Sri, or Gauri, is an object of sincere devotion.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Affinities of Hindu to other Mythologies.</h4>—But we must close
this digression; for such is the affinity between the mythology
of India, Greece, and Egypt, that a bare recapitulation of the
numerous surnames of the Hindu goddess of abundance would
lead us beyond reasonable limits; all are forms of Parvati or
Durga Mata, the Mater Montana of Greece and Rome, an epithet
of Cybele or Vesta (according to Diodorus), as the guardian
goddess of children, one of the characters of the Rajput ‘Mother
of the Mount,’ whose shrine crowns many a pinnacle in Mewar;
and who, with the prolific Gauri, is amongst the amiable forms
of the universal mother, whose functions are more varied and
extensive than her sisters of Egypt and of Greece. Like the
Ephesian Diana, Durga wears the crescent on her head. She is
also ‘the turreted Cybele,’ the guardian goddess of all places
of strength (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>durga</em></span>),<a id='r4.21.56' /><a href='#f4.21.56' class='c013'><sup>[56]</sup></a> and like her she is drawn or carried by the
lion. As Mata Janavi, ‘the Mother of Births,’ she is Juno
<span class='pageno' id='Page_673'>673</span>Lucina: as Padma, ‘whose throne is the lotos,’ she is the fair
Isis of the Nile: as Tripura,<a id='r4.21.57' /><a href='#f4.21.57' class='c013'><sup>[57]</sup></a> ‘governing the three worlds,’ and
Atmadevi, ‘the Goddess of Souls,’ she is the Hecate Triformis
of the Greeks. In short, her power is manifested under every
form from the birth, and all the [577] intermediate stages until
death; whether Janavi, Gauri, or the terrific Kali, the Proserpine
or Kalligeneia of the West.</div>

<p class='c001'>Whoever desires to witness one of the most imposing and
pleasing of Hindu festivals, let him repair to Udaipur, and behold
the rites of the lotus-queen Padma, the Gauri of Rajasthan.</p>

<p class='c001'>Chait (Sudi) 8th, which, being after the Ides, is the 23rd of
the month, is sacred to Devi, the goddess of every tribe; she is
called Asokashtami, and being the ninth night (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>nauratri</em></span>) from
the opening of their Floralia, they perform the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>homa</em></span>, or sacrifice
of fire. On this day a grand procession takes place to the Chaugan,
and every Rajput worships his tutelary divinity.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Birth of Rāma.</h4>—Chait (Sudi) 9th is the anniversary
of Rama, the grand beacon of the solar race, kept with great
rejoicings at Udaipur. Horses and elephants are worshipped,
and all the implements of war. A procession takes place to the
Chaugan, and the succeeding day, called the Dasahra or tenth,
is celebrated in Asoj.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Festival of Kamadeva.</h4>—The last days of spring are
dedicated to Kamadeva, the god of love. The scorching winds
of the hot season are already beginning to blow, when Flora
droops her head, and “the god of love turns anchorite”; yet
the rose continues to blossom, and affords the most fragrant
chaplets for the Rajputnis, amidst all the heats of summer. Of
this the queen of flowers, the jessamine (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>chameli</em></span>), white and
yellow, the mogra,<a id='r4.21.58' /><a href='#f4.21.58' class='c013'><sup>[58]</sup></a> the champaka, that flourish in extreme heat,
the ladies form garlands, which they twine in their dark hair,
weave into bracelets, or wear as pendent collars. There is no
city in the East where the adorations of the sex to Kamadeva are
more fervent than in ‘the city of the rising sun’ (Udayapura).
On the 13th and 14th of Chait they sing hymns handed down
by the sacred bards:</div>

<p class='c001'>“Hail, god of the flowery bow:<a id='r4.21.59' /><a href='#f4.21.59' class='c013'><sup>[59]</sup></a> hail, warrior with a fish on

of the sage to forsake him!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Glory to Madana, to Kama,<a id='r4.21.60' /><a href='#f4.21.60' class='c013'><sup>[60]</sup></a> the god of gods; to Him by

emotions of rapture!”—<cite>Bhavishya Purana.</cite><a id='r4.21.61' /><a href='#f4.21.61' class='c013'><sup>[61]</sup></a></p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Festivals in the month Baisākh: April-May.</h4>—There is but one
festival in this month of any note, when the grand procession
denominated the ‘Nakkara ki aswari’ (from the equestrians being
summoned, as already described, by the grand kettledrums from
the Tripolia), takes place; and this is against the canons of the
Hindu church, being instituted by the present Rana in S. 1847, a
memorable year in the calendar. It was in this year, on the 2nd
of Baisakh, that he commanded a repetition of the rites of Gauri, by
the name of the Little Ganggor; but this act of impiety was marked
by a sudden rise of the waters of the Pichola, the bursting of the
huge embankment, and the inundation of the lake’s banks, to the
destruction of one-third of the capital: life, property, mansions,
trees, all were swept away in the tremendous rush of water, whose
ravages are still marked by the site of streets and bazaars now
converted into gardens or places of recreation, containing thousands
of acres within the walls, subdivided by hedges of the cactus, the
natural fence of Mewar, which alike thrives in the valley or covers
the most barren spots of her highest hills. But although the superstitious
look grave, and add that a son was also taken from him
on this very day, yet the Rana persists in maintaining the fête
he established; the barge is manned, he and his chiefs circumnavigate
the Pichola, regale on ma’ajun, and terrify Varuna
(the water-god) with the pyrotechnic exhibitions.</div>

<p class='c001'>Although the court calendar of Udaipur notices only those
festivals on which State processions occur, yet there are many
minor fêtes, which are neither unimportant nor uninteresting.
We shall enumerate a few, alike in Baisakh, Jeth, and Asarh,
which are blank as to the Nakkara Aswari.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Savitrivrata Festival.</h4>—On the 29th Baisakh there is a fast
common to India peculiar to the women, who perform certain
rites under the sacred fig-tree (the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>vata</em></span> or <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>pipal</em></span>), to preserve
<span class='pageno' id='Page_675'>675</span>them from widowhood; and hence the name of the fast Savitri-vrata.<a id='r4.21.62' /><a href='#f4.21.62' class='c013'><sup>[62]</sup></a></div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Festivals in the month Jeth: May-June.</h4>—On the 2nd of Jeth,
when the sun is in the zenith, the Rajput ladies commemorate
the birth of the sea-born goddess Rambha, the queen of the naiads
or Apsaras,<a id='r4.21.63' /><a href='#f4.21.63' class='c013'><sup>[63]</sup></a> whose birth, like that of Venus, was from the froth
of the waters; and [579] hence the Rajput bards designate all
the fair messengers of heaven by the name of Apsaras, who
summon the ‘chosen’ from the field of battle, and convey him
to the ‘mansion of the sun.’<a id='r4.21.64' /><a href='#f4.21.64' class='c013'><sup>[64]</sup></a></div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Aranya-Shashthi Festival.</h4>—On the 6th of Jeth the ladies
have another festival called the Aranya Shashthi, because on this
day those desirous of offspring walk in the woods (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>aranya</em></span>) to
gather and eat certain herbs. Sir W. Jones has remarked the
analogy between this and the Druidic ceremony of gathering the
mistletoe (also on the Shashthi, or 6th day of the moon), as a
preservative against sterility.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Festivals in the month Āsārh: June-July.</h4>—Asarh, the initiative
month of the periodical rains, has no particular festivity at Udaipur,
though in other parts of India the Rathayatra, or procession of
the car of Vishnu or Jagannatha (lord of the universe) is well
known: this is on the 2nd and the 11th, ‘the night of the gods,’
when Vishnu (the sun) reposes four months.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Festivals in the month Sāwan: July-August.</h4>—Sawan, classically
Sravana. There are two important festivals, with processions,
in this month.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Tij.</h4>—The third, emphatically called ‘the Tij’ (third),
is sacred to the mountain goddess Parvati, being the day on which,
after long austerities, she was reunited to Siva: she accordingly
declared it holy, and proclaimed that whoever invoked her on
that day should possess whatever was desired. The Tij is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_676'>676</span>accordingly reverenced by the women, and the husbandman of
Rajasthan, who deems it a most favourable day to take possession
of land, or to reinhabit a deserted dwelling. When on the expulsion
of the predatory powers from the devoted lands of Mewar,
proclamations were disseminated far and wide, recalling the
expatriated inhabitants, they showed their love of country by
obedience to the summons. Collecting their goods and chattels,
they congregated from all parts, but assembled at a common
rendezvous to make their entry to the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>bapota</em></span>, ‘land of their sires,’
on the Tij of Sawan. On this fortunate occasion, a band of
three hundred men, women, and children, with colours flying,
drums beating, the females taking precedence with brass vessels
of water on their heads, and chanting the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>suhaila</em></span> (song of joy),
entered the town of Kapasan, to revisit their desolate dwellings
[580], and return thanks on their long-abandoned altars to
Parvati<a id='r4.21.65' /><a href='#f4.21.65' class='c013'><sup>[65]</sup></a> for a happiness they had never contemplated.</div>

<p class='c001'>Red garments are worn by all classes on this day, and at
Jaipur clothes of this colour are presented by the Raja to all the
chiefs. At that court the Tij is kept with more honour than at
Udaipur. An image of Parvati on the Tij, richly attired, is borne
on a throne by women chanting hymns, attended by the prince
and his nobles. On this day, fathers present red garments and
stuffs to their daughters.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Nāgpanchami Festival: Serpent Worship.</h4>—The 5th is the
Nagpanchami, or day set apart for the propitiation of the chief
of the reptile race, the Naga or serpent. Few subjects have more
occupied the notice of the learned world than the mysteries of
Ophite worship, which are to be traced wherever there existed
a remnant of civilization, or indeed of humanity; among the
savages of the savannahs<a id='r4.21.66' /><a href='#f4.21.66' class='c013'><sup>[66]</sup></a> of America, and the magi of Fars,
with whom it was the type of evil,—their Ahrimanes.<a id='r4.21.67' /><a href='#f4.21.67' class='c013'><sup>[67]</sup></a> The
Nagas, or serpent-genii of the Rajputs, have a semi-human
structure, precisely as Diodorus describes the snake-mother of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_677'>677</span>the Scythae, in whose country originated this serpent-worship,
engrafted on the tenets of Zardusht, of the Puranas of the priesthood
of Egypt, and on the fables of early Greece.<a id='r4.21.68' /><a href='#f4.21.68' class='c013'><sup>[68]</sup></a> Dupuis,
Volney, and other expounders of the mystery, have given an
astronomical solution to what they deem a varied ramification
of an ancient fable, of which that of Greece, ‘the dragon guarding
the fruits of Hesperides,’ may be considered the most elegant
version. Had these learned men seen those ancient sculptures

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Rākhi Festival.</h4>—This festival, which is held on the last
day of Sawan, was instituted in honour of the good genii, when
Durvasas the sage instructed Salono (the genius or nymph presiding
over the month of Sawan) to bind on <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>rakhis</em></span>, or bracelets, as charms
to avert evil. The ministers of religion and females alone are
privileged to bestow these charmed wrist-bands. The ladies of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_678'>678</span>Rajasthan, either by their handmaids or the family priests, send
a bracelet as the token of their esteem to such as they adopt as
brothers, who return gifts in acknowledgement of the honour.
The claims thus acquired by the fair are far stronger than those
of consanguinity: for illustration of which I may refer to an
incident already related in the annals of this house.<a id='r4.21.70' /><a href='#f4.21.70' class='c013'><sup>[70]</sup></a> Sisters also

<p class='c001'>This day is hailed by the Brahmans as indemnifying them for
their expenditure of silk and spangles, with which they decorate
the wrists of all who are likely to make a proper return.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Festivals in the month Bhādon: August-September.</h4>—On the
3rd there is a grand procession to the Chaugan; and the 8th, or
Ashtami, is the birth of Krishna, which will be described at large
in an account of Nathdwara. There are several holidays in this
month, when the periodical [582] rains are in full descent; but that
on the last but one (Sudi 14, or 29th) is the most remarkable.</div>

the ancestorial manes (the Pitrideva, or <em>father-gods</em>) of the Rajputs,
which continues for fifteen days. The Rana goes to the cemetery
at Ara, and performs at the cenotaph of each of his forefathers
the rites enjoined, consisting of ablutions, prayers, and the hanging
of garlands of flowers, and leaves sacred to the dead, on their
monuments. Every chieftain does the same amongst the altars
of the ‘great ancients’ (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>bara burha</em></span>); or, if absent from their

Indus and Ganges. Many of the tribes described by Strabo as dwelling
around the Caspian are enumerated amongst the thirty-six royal races of
India. One of these, the Sakasenae, supposed to be the ancestors of our own

Ayu, the ancestor of the Hindu as well as of the Tatar Induvansi. [Yavana
is the general term for a foreigner, especially the non-Hindu tribes of the
N.W. Frontier, and those beyond them.] The Asuras, who are so often
described as invaders of India, and which word has ordinarily a mere irreligious

<p class='c001'><a href='#r4.21.48'>48</a>. Hesus is probably derived from Iswara, or Isa, <em>the</em> god. Toth was the
Egyptian, and Teutates the Scandinavian, Mercury. I have elsewhere
attempted to trace the origin of the Suevi, Su, or Yeuts of Yeutland (Jutland),
to Yute, Getae, or Jat, of Central Asia, who carried thence the religion of
Buddha into India as well as to the Baltic. There is little doubt that the
races called Jotner, Jaeter, Jotuns, Jacts, and Yeuts, who followed the Asi
into Scandinavia, migrated from the Jaxartes, the land of the great Getae
(Massagetae); the leader was supposed to be endued with supernatural
powers, like the Buddhist, called Vidiavan, or magician, whose haunts
adjoined Aria, the cradle of the Magi. They are designated Aripunta [?],
under the sign of a serpent, the type of Budha; or Ahriman, ‘the foe of man.’

  <h3 class='c024'>CHAPTER 22</h3>
</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Khadga Sthapana, Sword Worship.</h4>—The festival in which
this imposing rite occurs is the Nauratri,<a id='r4.22.1' /><a href='#f4.22.1' class='c013'><sup>[1]</sup></a> sacred to the god of war,
commencing on the first of the month Asoj. It is essentially
martial, and confined to the Rajput, who on the departure of the
monsoon finds himself at liberty to indulge his passion whether
for rapine or revenge, both which in these tropical regions are
necessarily suspended during the rains. Arguing from the order
of the passions, we may presume that the first objects of emblematic
worship were connected with war [583], and we accordingly
find the highest reverence paid to arms by every nation of
antiquity. The Scythic warrior of Central Asia, the intrepid
Gete, admitted no meaner representative of the god of battle than
his own scimitar.<a id='r4.22.2' /><a href='#f4.22.2' class='c013'><sup>[2]</sup></a> He worshipped it, he swore by it; it was
buried with him, in order that he might appear before the martial
divinity in the other world as became his worshipper on earth:
for the Gete of Transoxiana, from the earliest ages, not only
believed in the soul’s immortality, and in the doctrine of rewards
and punishments hereafter, but, according to the father of history,
he was a monotheist; of which fact he has left a memorable
proof in the punishment of the celebrated Anacharsis, who, on
his return from a visit to Thales and his brother philosophers of
Greece, attempted to introduce into the land of the Saka (Sakatai)
the corrupted polytheism of Athens.</div>

<p class='c001'>If we look westward from this the central land of earliest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_680'>680</span>civilization, to Dacia, Thrace, Pannonia, the seats of the
Thyssagetae or western Getae, we find the same form of adoration
addressed to the emblem of Mars, as mentioned by Xenophon
in his memorable retreat, and practised by Alaric and his Goths,
centuries afterwards, in the Acropolis of Athens. If we transport
ourselves to the shores of Scandinavia, amongst the Cimbri and
Getae of Jutland, to the Ultima Thule, wherever the name of
Gete prevails, we shall find the same adoration paid by the Getic
warrior to his sword.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Frisian Frank also of Gothic race, adhered to this worship,
and transmitted it with the other rites of the Getic warrior of the
Jaxartes; such as the adoration of the steed, sacred to the sun,
the great god of the Massagetae, as well as of the Rajput, who
sacrificed it at the annual feast, or with his arms and wife burnt
it on his funeral pile. Even the kings of the ‘second race’ kept
up the religion of their Scythic sires from the Jaxartes, and the
bones of the war-horse of Chilperic were exhumed with those
of the monarch. These rites, as well as those long-cherished
chivalrous notions, for which the Salian Franks have ever been
conspicuous [584], had their birth in Central Asia; for though
contact with the more polished Arab softened the harsh character
of the western warrior, his thirst for glory, the romantic charm
which fed his passion, and his desire to please the fair, he inherited
from his ancestors on the shores of the Baltic, which were colonized
from the Oxus. Whether Charlemagne addressed his sword as
Joyeuse,<a id='r4.22.3' /><a href='#f4.22.3' class='c013'><sup>[3]</sup></a> or the Scandinavian hero Angantýr as the enchanted
blade Tyrfing (Hialmar’s bane), each came from one common
origin, the people which invented the custom of Khadga Sthapana,
or ‘adoration of the sword.’ But neither the falchion ‘made
by the dwarfs for Suafurlama,’ nor the redoubled sword of
Bayard with which he dubbed the first Francis,—not even the
enchanted brand of Ariosto’s hero, can for a moment compare
with the double-edged khanda (scimitar) annually worshipped
by the chivalry of Mewar. Before I descant on this monstrous
blade, I shall give an abstract of the ceremonies on each of the
nine days sacred to the god of war.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Dasahra Festival.</h4>—On the 1st of Asoj, after fasting,
ablution, and prayer on the part of the prince and his household,
the double-edged khanda is removed from the hall of arms
<span class='pageno' id='Page_681'>681</span>(<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>ayudhsala</em></span>), and having received the homage (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>puja</em></span>) of the court,
it is carried in procession to the Kishanpol (gate of Kishan),
where it is delivered to the Raj Jogi,<a id='r4.22.4' /><a href='#f4.22.4' class='c013'><sup>[4]</sup></a> the Mahants, and band of
Jogis assembled in front of the temple of Devi ‘<em>the</em> goddess,’
adjoining the portal of Kishan.<a id='r4.22.5' /><a href='#f4.22.5' class='c013'><sup>[5]</sup></a> By these, the monastic militant
adorers of Hara, the god of battle, the brand emblematic of the
divinity is placed<a id='r4.22.6' /><a href='#f4.22.6' class='c013'><sup>[6]</sup></a> on the altar before the image of his divine
consort. At three in the afternoon the nakkaras, or grand kettle-drums,
proclaim from the Tripolia<a id='r4.22.7' /><a href='#f4.22.7' class='c013'><sup>[7]</sup></a> the signal for the assemblage
of the chiefs with their retainers; and the Rana and his cavalcade
proceed direct to the stables, when a buffalo is sacrificed in honour
of the war-horse. Thence the procession moves to the temple of
Devi, where the Raja Krishan (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>Godi</em></span>) has proceeded. Upon this,
the Rana seats himself close to the Raj Jogi, presents two pieces
of [585] silver and a coco-nut, performs homage to the sword
(<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>khadga</em></span>), and returns to the palace.</div>

<p class='c001'>Asoj 2nd. In similar state he proceeds to the Chaugan, their
Champ de Mars, where a buffalo is sacrificed; and on the same
day another buffalo victim is felled by the nervous arm of a
Rajput, near the Toranpol, or triumphal gate. In the evening
the Rana goes to the temple of Amba Mata, the universal mother,
when several goats and buffaloes bleed to the goddess.</p>

<p class='c001'>The 3rd. Procession to the Chaugan, when another buffalo
is offered; and in the afternoon five buffaloes and two rams are
sacrificed to Harsiddh Mata.<a id='r4.22.8' /><a href='#f4.22.8' class='c013'><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>On the 4th, as on every one of the nine days, the first visit is
to the Champ de Mars: the day opens with the slaughter of a
buffalo. The Rana proceeds to the temple of Devi, when he
worships the sword, and the standard of the Raj Jogi, to whom,
as the high-priest of Siva, the god of war, he pays homage, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_682'>682</span>makes offering of sugar, and a garland of roses. A buffalo having
been previously fixed to a stake near the temple, the Rana sacrifices
him with his own hand, by piercing him from his travelling
throne (raised on men’s shoulders and surrounded by his vassals)
with an arrow. In the days of his strength, he seldom failed
almost to bury the feather in the flank of the victim; but on the
last occasion his enfeebled arm made him exclaim with Prithiraj,
when, captive and blind, he was brought forth to amuse the Tartar
despot, “I draw not the bow as in the days of yore.”</p>

<p class='c001'>On the 5th, after the usual sacrifice at the Chaugan, and an
elephant fight, the procession marches to the temple of Asapurna
(Hope); a buffalo and a ram are offered to the goddess adored
by all the Rajputs, and the tutelary divinity of the Chauhans.
On this day the lives of some victims are spared at the intercession
of the Nagar-Seth, or chief-magistrate,<a id='r4.22.9' /><a href='#f4.22.9' class='c013'><sup>[9]</sup></a> and those of his
faith, the Jains.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the 6th, the Rana visits the Chaugan, but makes no sacrifice.
In the afternoon, prayers and victims to Devi; and in the
evening the Rana visits Bhikharinath, the chief of the Kanphara
Jogis, or split-ear <a id='corr682.20'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='ascetics'>ascetics.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_682.20'><ins class='correction' title='ascetics'>ascetics.</ins></a></span></p>

<p class='c001'>The 7th. After the daily routine at the Chaugan, and sacrifices
to Devi (the goddess of destruction), the chief equerry is
commanded to adorn the steeds with their new caparisons, and
lead them to be bathed in the lake. At night, the sacred fire
(<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>hom</em></span>) is kindled, and a buffalo and a ram are sacrificed to Devi;
the Jogis [586] are called up and feasted on boiled rice and sweetmeats.
On the conclusion of this day, the Rana and his chieftains
visit the hermitage of Sukharia Baba, an anchorite of the Jogi sect.</p>

<p class='c001'>8th. There is the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>homa</em></span>, or fire-sacrifice in the palace. In the
afternoon, the prince, with a select cavalcade, proceeds to the
village of Samina, beyond the city walls, and visits a celebrated
Gosain.<a id='r4.22.10' /><a href='#f4.22.10' class='c013'><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>9th. There is no morning procession. The horses from the
royal stables, as well as those of the chieftains, are taken to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_683'>683</span>lake, and bathed by their grooms, and on returning from purification
they are caparisoned in their new housings, led forth, and
receive the homage of their riders, and the Rana bestows a largess
on the master of the horse, the equerries, and grooms. At three
in the afternoon, the nakkaras having thrice sounded, the whole
State insignia, under a select band, proceed to Mount Matachal,
and bring home the sword. When its arrival in the court of the
palace is announced, the Rana advances and receives it with due
homage from the hands of the Raj Jogi, who is presented with a
khilat; while the Mahant, who has performed all the austerities
during the nine days, has his <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>patra</em></span><a id='r4.22.11' /><a href='#f4.22.11' class='c013'><sup>[11]</sup></a> filled with gold and silver
coin. The whole of the Jogis are regaled, and presents are made
to their chiefs. The elephants and horses again receive homage,
and the sword, the shield, and spear are worshipped within the
palace. At three in the morning the prince takes repose.</p>

<p class='c001'>The 10th, or Dasahra,<a id='r4.22.12' /><a href='#f4.22.12' class='c013'><sup>[12]</sup></a> is a festival universally known in India,
and respected by all classes, although entirely military, being
commemorative of the day on which the deified Rama commenced
his expedition to Lanka for the redemption of Sita;<a id='r4.22.13' /><a href='#f4.22.13' class='c013'><sup>[13]</sup></a> the ‘tenth
of Asoj’ is consequently deemed by the Rajput a fortunate day
for warlike enterprise. The day commences with a visit from
the [587] prince or chieftain to his spiritual guide. Tents and
carpets are prepared at the Chaugan or Matachal mount, where
the artillery is sent; and in the afternoon the Rana, his chiefs,
and their retainers repair to the field of Mars, worship the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>khejra</em></span>
tree,<a id='r4.22.14' /><a href='#f4.22.14' class='c013'><sup>[14]</sup></a> liberate the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>nilkanth</em></span> or jay (sacred to Rama), and return
amidst a discharge of guns.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_684'>684</span>11th. In the morning, the Rana, with all the State insignia,
the kettledrums sounding in the rear, proceeds towards the
Matachal mount, and takes the muster of his troops, amidst
discharges of cannon, tilting, and display of horsemanship. The
spectacle is imposing even in the decline of this house. The
hilarity of the party, the diversified costume, the various forms,
colours, and decorations of the turbans, in which some have the
heron plume, or sprigs from some shrub sacred to the god of war;
the clusters of lances, shining matchlocks, and black bucklers,
the scarlet housings of the steeds, and waving pennons, recall
forcibly the glorious days of the devoted Sanga, or the immortal
Partap, who on such occasions collected round the black <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>changi</em></span>
and crimson banner of Mewar a band of sixteen thousand of his
own kin and clan, whose lives were their lord’s and their country’s.
The shops and bazaars are ornamented with festoons of flowers
and branches of trees, while the costliest cloths and brocades are
extended on screens, to do honour to their prince; the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>toran</em></span> (or
triumphal arch) is placed before the tent, on a column of which
he places one hand as he alights, and before entering makes
several circumambulations. All present offer their <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>nazars</em></span> to the
prince, the artillery fires, and the bards raise ‘the song of praise,’
celebrating the glories of the past; the fame of Samra, who fell
with thirteen thousand of his kin on the Ghaggar; of Arsi and
his twelve brave sons, who gave themselves as victims for the
salvation of Chitor; of Kumbha, Lakha, Sanga, Partap, Amra,
Raj, all descended of the blood of Rama, whose exploits, three
thousand five hundred years before, they are met to celebrate.
The situation of Matachal is well calculated for such a spectacle,
as indeed is the whole ground from the palace through the Delhi
portal to the mount, on which is erected one of the several castles
commanding the approaches to the city. The fort is dedicated
to Mata, though it would not long remain stable (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>achal</em></span>) before a
battery of thirty-six pounders. The guns are drawn up about
the termination of the slope of the natural glacis; the Rana
and his court remain on horseback [588] half up the ascent; and
while every chief or vassal is at liberty to leave his ranks, and
“witch the world with noble horsemanship,” there is nothing
tumultuous, nothing offensive in their mirth.</p>

<p class='c001'>The steeds purchased since the last festival are named, and
as the cavalcade returns, their grooms repeat the appellations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_685'>685</span>of each as the word is passed by the master of the horse; as Baj
Raj, ‘the royal steed’; Hayamor, ‘the chief of horses’; Manika,
‘the gem’; Bajra, ‘the thunderbolt,’ etc., etc. On returning
to the palace, gifts are presented by the Rana to his chiefs. The
Chauhan chief of Kotharia claims the apparel which his prince
wears on this day, in token of the fidelity of his ancestor to the
minor, Udai Singh, in Akbar’s wars. To others, a fillet or
<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>balaband</em></span> for the turban is presented; but all such compliments
are regulated by precedent or immediate merit.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Toran Arch.</h4>—Thus terminates the Nauratri festival sacred
to the god of war, which in every point of view is analogous to

Mataehala would scarcely claim the least notice, but that we
discover even in this emblem the origin of the triumphal arches
of antiquity, with many other rites which may be traced to the
Indo-Scythic races of Asia. The <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>toran</em></span> in its original form consisted
of two columns and an architrave, constituting the number
three, sacred to Hara, the god of war. In the progress of the
arts the architrave gave way to the Hindu arch, which consisted
of two or more ribs without the keystone, the apex being the
perpendicular junction of the archivaults; nor is the arc of the
<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>toran</em></span> semicircular, or any segment of a circle, but with that
graceful curvature which stamps with originality one of the arches
of the Normans, who may have brought it from their ancient
seats on the Oxus, whence it may also have been [589] carried
within the Indus. The cromlech, or trilithic altar in the centre
<span class='pageno' id='Page_686'>686</span>of all those monuments called Druidic, is most probably a <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>toran</em></span>,
sacred to the Sun-god Belenus, like Har, or Balsiva, the god of
battle, to whom as soon as a temple is raised the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>toran</em></span> is erected,
and many of these are exquisitely beautiful.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Gates.</h4>—An interesting essay might be written on portes and
<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>torans</em></span>, their names and attributes, and the genii presiding as
their guardians. Amongst all the nations of antiquity, the
portal has had its peculiar veneration: to pass it was a privilege
regarded as a mark of honour. The Jew Haman, in the true
Oriental style, took post at the king’s gate as an inexpugnable
position. The most pompous court in Europe takes its title from
its <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>porte</em></span>, where, as at Udaipur, all alight. The Tripolia, or triple
portal, the entry to the magnificent terrace in front of the Rana’s
palace, consists, like the Roman arcs of triumph, of three arches,
still preserving the numeral sacred to the god of battle, one of
whose titles is Tripura, which may be rendered Tripoli, or lord
of the three places of abode, or cities, but applied in its extensive
sense to the three worlds, heaven, earth, and hell. From the
Sanskrit <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>Pola</em></span> we have the Greek πύλη, <em>a gate</em>, or pass; and in
the guardian or <span lang="sa" xml:lang="sa"><em>Polia</em></span>, the πυλωρός or porter; while to this
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>langue mère</em></span> our own language is indebted, not only for its portes
and porters, but its doors (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>dwara</em></span>).<a id='r4.22.16' /><a href='#f4.22.16' class='c013'><sup>[16]</sup></a> Pylos signified also a pass;
so in Sanskrit these natural barriers are called <span lang="sa" xml:lang="sa"><em>Palas</em></span>, and hence
the poetical epithet applied to the aboriginal mountain tribes of
Rajasthan, namely, Palipati and Palindra, ‘lords of the pass.’<a id='r4.22.17' /><a href='#f4.22.17' class='c013'><sup>[17]</sup></a></div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Ganesa.</h4>—One of the most important of the Roman divinities
was Janus, whence Januae, or portals, of which he was the
guardian.<a id='r4.22.18' /><a href='#f4.22.18' class='c013'><sup>[18]</sup></a> A resemblance between the Ganesa of the Hindu
pantheon and the Roman Janus has been pointed out by Sir W.
Jones, but his analogy extended little beyond nominal similarity.
The fable of the birth of Ganesa furnishes us with the origin of
the worship of Janus, and as it has never been given, I shall
transcribe it from the bard Chand. Ganesa is the chief of the
genii<a id='r4.22.19' /><a href='#f4.22.19' class='c013'><sup>[19]</sup></a> attendant on the god of war, and was expressly formed by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_687'>687</span>Uma, the Hindu Juno, to guard the entrance of her caverned
retreat in the [590] Caucasus, where she took refuge from the
tyranny of the lord of Kailasa (Olympus), whose throne is fixed
amidst eternal snows on the summit of this peak of the gigantic
Caucasus (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>Koh-khasa</em></span>).<a id='r4.22.20' /><a href='#f4.22.20' class='c013'><sup>[20]</sup></a></div>

<p class='c001'>“Strife arose between Mahadeo and the faithful Parvati: she
fled to the mountains and took refuge in a cave. A crystal
fountain tempted her to bathe, but shame was awakened; she
dreaded being seen. Rubbing her frame, she made an image of
man; with her nail she sprinkled it with the water of life, and
placed it as guardian at the entrance of the cave.” Engrossed
with the recollection of Parvati,<a id='r4.22.21' /><a href='#f4.22.21' class='c013'><sup>[21]</sup></a> Siva went to Karttikeya<a id='r4.22.22' /><a href='#f4.22.22' class='c013'><sup>[22]</sup></a> for
tidings of his mother, and together they searched each valley and
recess, and at length reached the spot where a figure was placed
at the entrance of a cavern. As the chief of the gods prepared to
explore this retreat, he was stopped by the Polia. In a rage he
struck off his head with his discus (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>chakra</em></span>), and in the gloom
discovered the object of his search. Surprised and dismayed,
she demanded how he obtained ingress: “Was there no guardian
at the entrance?” The furious Siva replied that he had cut
off his head. On hearing this, the mountain-goddess was enraged,
and weeping, exclaimed, “You have destroyed my child.” The
god, determined to recall him to life, decollated a young elephant,
replaced the head he had cut off, and naming him Ganesa, decreed
that in every resolve his name should be the first invoked.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, Ganesa! thou art a mighty lord; thy single tusk<a id='r4.22.23' /><a href='#f4.22.23' class='c013'><sup>[23]</sup></a> is

unclean spirits; the remover of fevers, whether daily or tertian.
Thy bard sounds thy praise; let my work be accomplished!”</p>

</div>

<p class='c015'>Thus Ganesa is the chief of the Di minores of the Hindu
pantheon, as the etymology of the word indicates,<a id='r4.22.25' /><a href='#f4.22.25' class='c013'><sup>[25]</sup></a> and like Janus,
was entrusted with the gates of heaven [591]; while of his right
to preside over peace and war, the fable related affords abundant
testimony. Ganesa is the first invoked and propitiated<a id='r4.22.26' /><a href='#f4.22.26' class='c013'><sup>[26]</sup></a> on
every undertaking, whether warlike or pacific. The warrior
implores his counsel; the banker indites his name at the commencement
of every letter; the architect places his image in the
foundation of every edifice; and the figure of Ganesa is either
sculptured or painted at the door of every house as a protection
against evil. Our Hindu Janus is represented as four-armed, and
holding the disk (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>chakra</em></span>), the war-shell, the club, and the lotos.
Ganesa is not, however, <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>bifrons</em></span>, like the Roman guardian of
portals. In every transaction he is <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>adi</em></span>, or the first, though the
Hindu does not, like the Roman, open the year with his name.
I shall conclude with remarking that one of the portes of every
Hindu city is named the Ganesa Pol, as well as some conspicuous
entrance to the palace: thus Udaipur has its Ganesa dwara,
who also gives a name to the hall, the Ganesa deori; and his
shrine will be found on the ascent of every sacred mount, as at
Abu, where it is placed close to a fountain on the abrupt face
about twelve hundred feet from the base. There is likewise a
hill sacred to him in Mewar called Ganesa Gir, tantamount to the
Mons Janiculum of the eternal city. The companion of this
divinity is a rat, who indirectly receives a portion of homage, and
with full as much right as the bird emblematic of Minerva.<a id='r4.22.27' /><a href='#f4.22.27' class='c013'><sup>[27]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_689'>689</span>We have abandoned the temple of the warlike divinity (Devi),
the sword of Mars, and the triumphal <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>toran</em></span>, to invoke Ganesa.
It will have been remarked that the Rana aids himself to dismount
by placing his hand on one of the columns of the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>toran</em></span>, an act
which is pregnant with a martial allusion, as are indeed the entire
ceremonials of the “worship of the sword.”</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Analogies to Western Customs. Oaths by the Sword.</h4>—It
might be deemed folly to trace the rites and superstitions of so
remote an age and nation to Central Asia; but when we find the
superstitions of the Indo-Scythic Getae prevailing within the
Indus, in Dacia, and on the shores of the Baltic, we may assume
their common origin; for although the worship of arms has
prevailed among all warlike tribes, there is a peculiar respect
paid to the sword amongst the Getic races. The Greeks and
Romans paid devotion to their arms, and swore by them. The
Greeks brought their habits from ancient Thrace, where the
custom existed of presenting as the greatest gift that peculiar
kind of sword called <em>acinaces</em>,<a id='r4.22.28' /><a href='#f4.22.28' class='c013'><sup>[28]</sup></a> which we dare not derive from
the Indo-Scythic or Sanskrit <span lang="sa" xml:lang="sa"><em>asi</em></span>, a [592] sword. When Xenophon,<a id='r4.22.29' /><a href='#f4.22.29' class='c013'><sup>[29]</sup></a>
on his retreat, reached the court of Seuthes, he agreed to
attach his corps to the service of the Thracian. His officers on
introduction, in the true Oriental style, presented their <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>nazars</em></span>,
or gifts of homage, excepting Xenophon, who, deeming himself
too exalted to make the common offering, presented his sword,
probably only to be touched in recognition of his services being
accepted. The most powerful oath of the Rajput, next to his
sovereign’s throne (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>gaddi ka an</em></span>), is by his arms, <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>ya silah ka an</em></span>,
‘by this weapon!’ as, suiting the action to the word, he puts
his hand on his dagger, never absent from his girdle. <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>Dhal,
tarwar, ka an</em></span>, ‘by my sword and shield!’ The shield is deemed
the only fit vessel or salver on which to present gifts; and accordingly
at a Rajput court, shawls, brocades, scarfs, and jewels are
always spread before the guest on bucklers.<a id='r4.22.30' /><a href='#f4.22.30' class='c013'><sup>[30]</sup></a></div>

Soon they made proof of Maldeo’s hardihood. Uncovering
the cauldron, he beheld a sight most appalling: amidst divers
fragments of animals was the arm of an infant. A dish of this
horrid repast was placed before him, and a silent signal made for
him to eat. He obeyed, and returned the empty platter: it was
proof sufficient of his worth to wear the enchanted blade, which,
drawn forth from its secret abode, was put into the hand of
Maldeo, who bowing, retired with the trophy [595].</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Birth of Kumāra.</h4>—We shall conclude this account of the
military festival of Mewar with the birth of Kumara, the god of
war, taken from the most celebrated of their mythological poems,
the Ramayana, probably the most ancient book in the world.<a id='r4.22.44' /><a href='#f4.22.44' class='c013'><sup>[44]</sup></a>
“Mena, daughter of Meru, became the spouse of Himavat, from
whose union sprung the beauteous Ganga, and her sister Uma.
Ganga was sought in marriage by all the celestials; while Uma,
after a long life of austerity, was espoused by Rudra.”<a id='r4.22.45' /><a href='#f4.22.45' class='c013'><sup>[45]</sup></a> But
neither sister was fortunate enough to have offspring, until Ganga
became pregnant by Hutasana (regent of fire), and “Kumara,
resplendent as the sun, illustrious as the moon, was produced
from the side of Ganga.” The gods, with Indra at their head,
carried him to the Krittikas<a id='r4.22.46' /><a href='#f4.22.46' class='c013'><sup>[46]</sup></a> to be nursed, and he became their
joint care. “As he resembled the fire in brightness, he received
the name of Skanda, when the immortals, with Agni (fire) at
their head, anointed him as general of the armies of the gods.”<a id='r4.22.47' /><a href='#f4.22.47' class='c013'><sup>[47]</sup></a>—“Thus
(the bard Valmiki speaks), oh! Rama, have I related the
story of the production of Kumar.”</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_694'>694</span>This is a very curious relic of ancient mythology, in which we
may trace the most material circumstances of the birth of the
Roman divinity of war. Kumara (Mars) was the son of Jahnavi
(Juno), and born, like the Romans, without sexual intercourse,
but by the agency of Vulcan (regent of fire). Kumara has the
peacock (sacred to Juno likewise) as his companion; and as the
Grecian goddess is feigned to have her car drawn by peacocks,
so Kumara (the evil-striker)<a id='r4.22.48' /><a href='#f4.22.48' class='c013'><sup>[48]</sup></a> has a peacock for his steed [596].
Ganga, ‘the river goddess,’ has some of the attributes of
Pallas, being like the Athenian maid (Ganga never married) born
from the head of Jove. The bard of the silver age makes her
fall from a glacier of Kailasa (Olympus) on the head of the father
of the gods, and remain many years within the folds of his tiara
(<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>jata</em></span>), until at length being liberated, she was precipitated into
the plains of Aryavarta. It was in this escape that she burst
her rocky barrier (the Himalaya), and on the birth of Kumara
exposed those veins of gold called <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>jambunadi</em></span>, in colour like the
jambu fruit, probably alluding to the veins of gold discovered in

goddess, by her votaries of all classes, but especially by the
mercantile [597]. On the 14th, all anoint with oil, and make
libations thereof to Yama, the judge of departed spirits. Worship
(<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>puja</em></span>) is performed to the lamp, which represents the god

to the peasant’s hut every one supplies himself with them, in
proportion to his means, and arranges them according to his
fancy. Stuffs, pieces of gold, and sweetmeats are carried in
trays and consecrated at the temple of Lakshmi, the goddess
of wealth, to whom the day is consecrated. The Rana on this
occasion honours his prime minister with his presence to dinner;
and this chief officer of the State, who is always of the mercantile
caste, pours oil into a terra-cotta lamp, which his sovereign
holds; the same libation of oil is permitted by each of the near
relations of the minister. On this day, it is incumbent upon
every votary of Lakshmi to try the chance of the dice, and from
their success in the Diwali, the prince, the chief, the merchant,

grain and adorned with flowers as her representative; or, if they
adorn her effigies, they are those of Padma, the water-nymph,
with a lotos in one hand, and the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>pasa</em></span> (or fillet for the head) in
the other. As Lakshmi was produced at “the Churning of the
Ocean,” and hence called one of the “fourteen gems,” she is
confounded with Rambha, chief of the Apsaras, the Venus of the
Hindus. Though both were created from the froth (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>sara</em></span>) of the
waters (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>ap</em></span>),<a id='r4.22.50' /><a href='#f4.22.50' class='c013'><sup>[50]</sup></a> they are as distinct as the representations of riches
and beauty can be. Lakshmi became the wife of Vishnu, or
Kanhaiya, and is placed at the feet of his marine couch when he
is floating on the chaotic waters. As his consort, she merges
into the character of Sarasvati, the goddess of eloquence, and
here we have the combination of Minerva and Apollo. As of
Minerva, the owl [598] is the attendant of Lakshmi;<a id='r4.22.51' /><a href='#f4.22.51' class='c013'><sup>[51]</sup></a> and when
we reflect that the Egyptians, who furnished the Grecian pantheon,
held these solemn festivals, also called “the feast of
lamps,” in honour of Minerva at Sais, we may deduce the origin
of this grand Oriental festival from that common mother-country
in Central Asia, whence the Diwali radiated to remote China, the
Nile, the Ganges, and the shores of the Tigris; for the Shab-i-barat
of Islam is but “the feast of lamps” of the Rajputs. In all
these there is a mixture of the attributes of Ceres and Proserpine,
of Plutus and Pluto. Lakshmi partakes of the attributes of
both the first, while Kuvera,<a id='r4.22.52' /><a href='#f4.22.52' class='c013'><sup>[52]</sup></a> who is conjoined with her, is Plutus:
as Yama is Pluto, the infernal judge. The consecrated lamps
and the libations of oil are all dedicated to him; and “torches
and flaming brands are likewise kindled and consecrated, to burn
the bodies of kinsmen who may be dead in battle in a foreign
land, and light them through the shades of death to the mansion
of Yama.”<a id='r4.22.53' /><a href='#f4.22.53' class='c013'><sup>[53]</sup></a></p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Festival of Yama.</h4>—To the infernal god Yama, who is “the
son of the sun,” the second day following the Amavas, or Ides of
Karttika, is also sacred; it is called the Bhratri dvitiya, or ‘the
brothers’ second,’ because the river-goddess Yamuna on this day
<span class='pageno' id='Page_697'>697</span>entertained her brother (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>bhratri</em></span>) Yama, and is therefore consecrated
to fraternal affection. At the hour of curfew (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>godhuli</em></span>),<a id='r4.22.54' /><a href='#f4.22.54' class='c013'><sup>[54]</sup></a>
when the cattle return from the fields, the cow is worshipped,
the herd having been previously tended. From this ceremony
no rank is exempted on the preceding day, dedicated to Krishna:
prince and peasant all become pastoral attendants on the cow,
as the form of Prithivi,<a id='r4.22.55' /><a href='#f4.22.55' class='c013'><sup>[55]</sup></a> or the earth.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Annakūta Festival.</h4>—The 1st (Sudi), or 16th of Karttika,
is the grand festival of Annakuta, sacred to the Hindu Ceres,
which will be described with its solemnities at Nathdwara. There
is a State procession, horse-races, and elephant-fights at the
Chaugan; the evening closes with a display of fireworks.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Jaljātra Festival.</h4>—The 14th (Sudi), or 29th, is another
solemn festival in honour of Vishnu. It is called the Jaljatra,
from being performed on the water (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>jal</em></span>). The Rana, chiefs,
ministers, and citizens go in procession to the lake, and adore the
“spirit of the waters,” on which floating lights are placed, and
the whole surface is illuminated by a grand display of pyrotechny.
On this day “Vishnu rises from his slumber of four [599]
months”;<a id='r4.22.56' /><a href='#f4.22.56' class='c013'><sup>[56]</sup></a> a figurative expression to denote the sun’s emerging
from the cloudy months of the periodical flood.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Makara Sankrānti Festival.</h4>—The next day (the Punim,
or last day of Karttika), being the Makara sankranti, or autumnal
equinox, when the sun enters the zodiacal sign Makara,<a id='r4.22.57' /><a href='#f4.22.57' class='c013'><sup>[57]</sup></a> or Pisces,
the Rana and chiefs proceed in state to the Chaugan, and play
at ball on horseback. The entire last half of the month Karttika,
from Amavas (the Ides) to the Punim, is sacred to Vishnu; who
is declared by the Puranas to represent the sun, and whose
worship, that of water, and the floating-lights placed thereon—all
objects emblematic of fecundity—carry us back to the point
whence we started—the adoration of the powers of nature: clearly
proving all mythology to be universally founded on an astronomical
basis.</div>

<div class='section-start'><span class='pageno' id='Page_698'>698</span><h4 class='disp-inline'>Mitra Saptami, Bhāskara Saptami Festivals.</h4>—In the remaining
months of Aghan, or Margsir, and Pus, there are no festivals in
which a state procession takes place, though in each there are
marked days, kept not only by the Rajputs, but generally by
the Hindu nation; especially that on the 7th of Aghan, which
is called Mitra Saptami, or 7th of Mithras, and like the Bhaskara
Saptami or the 7th of Magha, is sacred to the sun as a form
of Vishnu. On this seventh day occurred the descent of the
river-goddess (Ganga) from the foot of Vishnu; or the genius of
fertilization, typified under the form of the river-goddess, proceeding
from the sun, the vivifying principle, and impended over
the head of Iswara, the divinity presiding over generation, in
imitation of which his votary pours libations of water (if possible
from the sacred river Ganga) over his emblem, the lingam or
phallus: a comparison which is made by the bard Chand in an
invocation to this god, for the sake of contrasting his own inferiority
“to the mighty bards of old.”</div>

<p class='c001'>“The head of Is<a id='r4.22.58' /><a href='#f4.22.58' class='c013'><sup>[58]</sup></a> is in the skies; on his crown falls the ever-flowing

votary pour the fluid from his <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>patra</em></span>?”</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Phallicism.</h4>—No satisfactory etymology has ever been assigned
for the phallic emblem of generation, adored by Egyptian, Greek,
Roman, and even by the Christian, which may be from the same
primeval language that formed the Sanskrit.</div>

<p class='c001'>Phalisa is the ‘fructifier,’ from <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>phala</em></span>, ‘fruit,’ and <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>Isa</em></span>, ‘the
god.’<a id='r4.22.59' /><a href='#f4.22.59' class='c013'><sup>[59]</sup></a> Thus the type of Osiris can have a definite interpretation,
still wanting to the lingam of Iswara [600]. Both deities presided
over the streams which fertilized the countries in which they
received divine honours: Osiris over the Nile, from ‘the mountains
of the moon,’ in Ethiopia,<a id='r4.22.60' /><a href='#f4.22.60' class='c013'><sup>[60]</sup></a> Iswara over the Indus<a id='r4.22.61' /><a href='#f4.22.61' class='c013'><sup>[61]</sup></a> (also
called the Nil), and the Ganges from Chandragiri, ‘the mountains
of the moon,’ on a peak of whose glaciers he has his throne.</p>

<div class='section-start'><span class='pageno' id='Page_699'>699</span><h4 class='disp-inline'>Siva and the Sun.</h4>—Siva occasionally assumes the attributes
of the sun-god; they especially appertain to Vishnu, who alone
is styled “immortal, the one, creator, and uncreated”; and in
whom centre all the qualities (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>gunan</em></span>), which have peopled the
Hindu pantheon with their ideal representatives. The bard
Chand, who has embodied the theological tenets of the Rajputs
in his prefatory invocation to every divinity who can aid his
intent, apostrophizes Ganesa, and summons the goddess of
eloquence (Sarasvati) “to make his tongue her abode”; deprecates
the destroying power, “him whom wrath inhabits,” lest
he should be cut off ere his book was finished; and lauding
distinctly each member of the triad (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>trimurti</em></span>), he finishes by
declaring them one, and that “whoever believes them separate,
hell will be his portion.” Of this One the sun is the great visible
type, adored under a variety of names, as Surya, Mitra, Bhaskar,
Vivasvat, Vishnu, Karna, or Kana, likewise an Egyptian epithet
for the sun.<a id='r4.22.62' /><a href='#f4.22.62' class='c013'><sup>[62]</sup></a></div>

<p class='c001'>The emblem of Vishnu is Garuda, or the eagle,<a id='r4.22.63' /><a href='#f4.22.63' class='c013'><sup>[63]</sup></a> and the Sun-god
both of the Egyptians and Hindus is typified with the bird’s
head. Aruna (the dawn), brother of Garuda, is classically styled
the charioteer of Vishnu, whose two sons, Sampati and Jatayu,
attempting in imitation of their father to reach the sun, the wings
of the former were burnt and he fell to the earth: of this the
Greeks may have made their fable of Icarus.<a id='r4.22.64' /><a href='#f4.22.64' class='c013'><sup>[64]</sup></a></p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Festivals in Honour of Vishnu.</h4>—In the chief zodiacal phenomena,
observation will discover that Vishnu is still the object of
worship. The Phuladola,<a id='r4.22.65' /><a href='#f4.22.65' class='c013'><sup>[65]</sup></a> or Floralia, in the vernal equinox, is
so called from the image of Vishnu being carried in a <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>dola</em></span>, or ark,
covered with garlands of flowers (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>phula</em></span>). Again, in the month
of Asarh, the commencement of [601] the periodical rains, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_700'>700</span>date from the summer solstice, the image of Vishnu is carried on
a car, and brought forth on the first appearance of the moon, the
11th of which being the solstice, is called “the night of the gods.”
Then Vishnu reposes on his serpent-couch until the cessation of
the flood on the 11th of Bhadon, when “he turns on his side.”<a id='r4.22.66' /><a href='#f4.22.66' class='c013'><sup>[66]</sup></a></div>

<p class='c001'>The 4th is also dedicated to Vishnu under his infantine appellation
Hari (Ἥλιος), because when a child “he hid himself in the
moon.” We must not derogate from Sir W. Jones the merit of
drawing attention to the analogy between these Hindu festivals
on the equinoxes, and the Egyptian, called the entrance of Osiris
into the moon, and his confinement in an ark. But that distinguished
writer merely gives the hint, which the learned Bryant
aids us to pursue, by bringing modern travellers to corroborate
the ancient authorities: the drawings of Pocock from the sun
temple of Luxor to illustrate Plutarch, Curtius, and Diodorus.
Bryant comes to the same conclusion with regard to Osiris
enclosed in the ark, which we adopt regarding Vishnu’s repose
during the four months of inundation, the period of fertilization.
I have already, in the rites of Annapurna, the Isis of the Egyptians,
noticed the crescent form of the ark of Osiris, as well as the ram’s-head
ornaments indicative of the vernal equinox, which the
Egyptians called Phamenoth, being the birthday of Osiris, or the
sun; the Phag, or Phalgun month of the Hindus; the Phagesia
of the Greeks, sacred to Dionysus.<a id='r4.22.67' /><a href='#f4.22.67' class='c013'><sup>[67]</sup></a></p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Argonauts.</h4>—The expedition of Argonauts in search of the
golden fleece is a version of the arkite worship of Osiris, the
Dolayatra of the Hindus: and Sanskrit etymology, applied to
the vessel of the Argonauts, will give the sun (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>argha</em></span>) god’s (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>natha</em></span>)
entrance into the sign of the Ram. The Tauric and Hydra foes,
with which Jason had to contend before he obtained the fleece
of Aries, are the symbols of the sun-god, both of the Ganges and
the Nile; and this fable, which has occupied almost every pen
of antiquity, is clearly astronomical, as the names alone of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_701'>701</span>Arghanath, sons of Apollo, Mars, Mercury, Sol, Arcus or Argus,<a id='r4.22.68' /><a href='#f4.22.68' class='c013'><sup>[68]</sup></a>
Jupiter, Bacchus, etc., sufficiently testify, whose voyage is entirely
celestial.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Egyptian Influence on Hindu Mythology.</h4>—If it be destined
that any portion of the veil which covers these ancient mysteries
[602], connecting those of the Ganges with the Nile, shall be
removed, it will be from the interpretation of the expedition of
Rama, hitherto deemed almost as allegorical as that of the
Arghanaths. I shall at once assume an opinion I have long
entertained, that the western coast of the Red Sea was the Lanka
of the memorable exploit in the history of the Hindus. If
Alexander from the mouths of the Indus ventured to navigate
those seas with his frail fleet of barks constructed in the Panjab,
what might we not expect from the resources of the King of
Kosala, the descendant of Sagara, emphatically called the sea-king,
whose “60,000 sons” were so many mariners, and who has
left his name as a memorial of his marine power at the island
(<span lang="sa" xml:lang="sa"><em>Sagar</em></span>) at the embouchure of the main arm of the Ganges, and
to the ocean itself, also called Sagara? If the embarkation of
Ramesa and his heroes for the redemption of Sita had been from
the Gulph of Cutch, the grand emporium from the earliest ages,
the voyage of Rama would have been but the prototype of that
of the Macedonians; but local tradition has sanctified Rameswaram,
the southern part of the peninsula, as the rendezvous of
his armament. The currents in the Straits of Manar, curiosity,
or a wish to obtain auxiliaries from this insular kingdom, may
have prompted the visit to Ceylon; and hence the vestiges there
found of this event. But even from this “utmost isle, Taprobane,”
the voyage across the Erythrean Sea is only twenty-five
degrees of longitude, which with a flowing sail they would run
down in ten or twelve days. The only difficulty which occurs is
in the synchronical existence of Rama and the Pharaoh<a id='r4.22.69' /><a href='#f4.22.69' class='c013'><sup>[69]</sup></a> of
Moses, which would tend to the opposite of my hypothesis, and
show that India received her Phallic rites, her architecture, and
symbolic mythology from the Nile, instead of planting them
there.</div>

of the Phallic worship.<a id='r4.22.70' /><a href='#f4.22.70' class='c013'><sup>[70]</sup></a> Ramesa, chief of the Suryas, or sun-born
race, was king of the city designated from his mother,

and Kushites, or Kushwas of India.<a id='r4.22.71' /><a href='#f4.22.71' class='c013'><sup>[71]</sup></a> Was then Kausalya [603]
the mother of Ramesa, a native of Aethiopia,<a id='r4.22.72' /><a href='#f4.22.72' class='c013'><sup>[72]</sup></a> or Kusadwipa,
‘the land of Cush’? Rama and Krishna are both painted blue
(<cite>nila</cite>), holding the lotus, emblematic of the Nile. Their names
are often identified. Ram-Krishna, the bird-headed divinity,
is painted as the messenger of each, and the historians of both
were contemporaries. That both were real princes there is no
doubt, though Krishna assumed to be an incarnation of Vishnu,
as Rama was of the sun. Of Rama’s family was Trisankha,<a id='r4.22.73' /><a href='#f4.22.73' class='c013'><sup>[73]</sup></a>
mother of the great apostle of Buddha, whose symbol was the
serpent; and the followers of Buddha assert that Krishna and
this apostle, whose statues are facsimiles of those of Memnon,
were cousins. Were the Hermetic creed and Phallic rites therefore
received from the Ethiopic Cush? Could emblematic relics
be discovered in the caves of the Troglodytes, who inhabited the
range of mountains on the Cushite shore of the Arabian straits,
akin to those of Ellora and Elephanta,<a id='r4.22.74' /><a href='#f4.22.74' class='c013'><sup>[74]</sup></a> whose style discloses
physical, mythological, as well as architectural affinity to the

<p class='c001'>I have derived the Phallus from Phalisa, the chief fruit. The
Greeks, who either borrowed it from the Egyptians or had it

<p class='c001'>The Sriphala<a id='r4.22.79' /><a href='#f4.22.79' class='c013'><sup>[79]</sup></a> is accordingly presented to all the votaries of

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_704'>704</span>The analogy between the goddess of the spring Saturnalia,

<p class='c001'>From the existence of this worship in Congo at this day, the

five complementary days called ”ἠπαγόμεναι ἡμέραι” preceding
New Year’s Day, the Egyptians celebrated the birth of the
sun-god Osiris, in a similar manner as the Hindus do their solstitial
festival, “the morning of the gods,” the Hiul of Scandinavia;
on which occasion, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“on promenait en procession une figure
d’Osiris, dont le Phallus était triple”</span>; a number, he adds, expressing
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“la pluralité indéfinie.”</span> The number three is sacred to
Iswara, chief of the Trimurti or Triad, whose statue adorns the
junction (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>sangam</em></span>) of all triple streams; hence called Triveni,
who is [605] Trinetra, or ‘three-eyed,’ and Tridanta, or ‘god of
the trident’; Triloka, ‘god of the triple abode, heaven, earth,
and hell’; Tripura, of the triple city, to whom the Tripoli or
triple gates are sacred, and of which he has made Ganesa the
Janitor, or guardian. The grotesque figure placed by the Hindus
during the Saturnalia in the highways, and called Nathurama
<span class='pageno' id='Page_705'>705</span>(the god Rama), is the counterpart of the figure described by
Plutarch as representing Osiris, “ce soleil printanier,” in the
Egyptian Saturnalia or Phamenoth. Even Ramisa and Ravana
may, like Osiris and Typhon, be merely the ideal representatives
of light and darkness; and the chaste Sita, spouse of the Surya
prince, the astronomical Virgo, only a zodiacal sign.<a id='r4.22.83' /><a href='#f4.22.83' class='c013'><sup>[83]</sup></a></p>

the good and benevolent of the Hindu nations may have ulterior
advantages over those Pharisees who would make a monopoly
even of the virtues; who “see the mote in their neighbour’s eye,
but cannot discern the beam in their own.” While, therefore,
we strive to impart a purer taste and better faith, let us not
imagine that the minds of those we would reform are the seats
of impurity, because, in accordance with an idolatry coeval with
the flood, they continue to worship mysteries opposed to our

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Character of the Rājput. Influence of Custom.</h4>—The
manners of a nation constitute the most interesting portion of
its history, but a thorough knowledge of them must be the fruit
of long and attentive observation: an axiom which applies to
a people even less inaccessible than the Rajputs. The importance
and necessity of such an illustration of the Rajput character,
in a work like the present, call for and sanction the attempt,
however inadequate the means. Of what value to mankind
would be the interminable narrative of battles, were their moral
causes and results passed by unheeded? Although both the
Persian and Hindu annalists not unfrequently unite the characters
of moralist and historian, it is in a manner unsuitable to the
subject, according to the more refined taste of Europe. In the
poetic annals of the Rajput, we see him check his war-chariot,
and when he should be levelling his javelin, commence a discourse
upon ethics; or when the battle is over, the Nestor or Ulysses of
the host converts his tent into a lyceum, and delivers lectures
on morals or manners. But the reflections which should follow,
and form the corollary to each action, are never given; and
even if they were, though we might comprehend the moral
movements of a nation, we should still be unable to catch the
minute shades of character that complete the picture of domestic
life, and which are to be collected from those familiar sentiments
uttered in social intercourse, when the mind unbends and nature
throws aside the trammels of education and of ceremony. Such
a picture would represent the manners, which are continually
undergoing modifications, in contradistinction to the morals of
society; the latter, having a fixed creed for their basis, are
definite and unchangeable. The <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>chal</em></span> of the Rajput, like the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>mores</em></span> of the Romans, or <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><em>costumi</em></span> of modern Italy, is significant
alike of mental and external habit. In the moral point of view
it is the path chalked out for him by the sages of antiquity [608];
in the personal, it is that which custom has rendered immutable.
<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>Kaisi buri chal men chalta</em></span>, ‘in what a bad path does he march!’
says the moralist: <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>Bap, Dada ki chal chhori</em></span>, ‘he abandons
<span class='pageno' id='Page_708'>708</span>the usages of his ancestors,’ says the stickler for custom, in
Rajasthan.<a id='r4.23.1' /><a href='#f4.23.1' class='c013'><sup>[1]</sup></a></div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Rājput Morals.</h4>—The grand features of morality are few, and
nearly the same in every nation not positively barbarous. The
principles contained in the Decalogue form the basis of every
code—of Manu and of Muhammad, as well as of Moses. These
are grand landmarks of the truth of divine history; and are confirmed
by the less important traits of personal customs and
religious rites, which nations the most remote from each other
continue to hold in common. The Koran we know to have been
founded on the Mosaic law; the Sastra of Manu, unconsciously,
approaches still more to the Jewish Scriptures in spirit and intention;
and from its pages might be formed a manual of moral
instruction, which, if followed by the disciples of the framer,
might put more favoured societies to the blush.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Variety of Customs due to Environment.</h4>—As it has been
observed in a former part of this work, the same religion governing
all must tend to produce a certain degree of mental uniformity.
The shades of moral distinction which separate these races are
almost imperceptible: while you cannot pass any grand natural
barrier without having the dissimilarity of customs and manners
forced upon your observation. Whoever passes from upland
Mewar, the country of the Sesodias, into the sandy flats of Marwar,
the abode of the Rathors, would feel the force of this remark.
Innovations proceeding from external causes, such as conquest
by irreligious foes, and the birth of new sects and schisms, operate
important changes in manners and customs. We can only
pretend, however, to describe facts which are obvious, and those
which history discloses, whence some notions may be formed of
the prevailing traits of character in the Rajput; his ideas of
virtue and vice, the social intercourse and familiar courtesies of
Rajasthan, and their recreations, public and private.</div>

<p class='c001'>“The manners of a people,” says the celebrated Goguet,
“always bear a proportion to the progress they have made in
the arts and sciences.” If by this test we trace the analogy
between past and existing manners amongst the Rajputs, we
must conclude at once that they have undergone a decided
<span class='pageno' id='Page_709'>709</span>deterioration. Where can we look for sages like those whose
systems of philosophy were the [609] prototypes of those of
Greece: to whose works Plato, Thales, and Pythagoras were
disciples? Where shall we find the astronomers, whose knowledge
of the planetary system yet excites wonder in Europe, as
well as the architects and sculptors, whose works claim our admiration,
and the musicians, “who could make the mind oscillate
from joy to sorrow, from tears to smiles, with the change of
modes and varied intonation.”<a id='r4.23.2' /><a href='#f4.23.2' class='c013'><sup>[2]</sup></a> The manners of those days
must have corresponded with this advanced stage of refinement,
as they must have suffered from its decline: yet the homage
paid by Asiatics to precedent has preserved many relics of
ancient customs, which have survived the causes that produced
them.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Treatment of Women by the Rājputs.</h4>—It is universally admitted
that there is no better criterion of the refinement of a nation
than the condition Of the fair sex therein. As it is elegantly
expressed by Comte Ségur, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Leur sort est <a id='corr709.18'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='un boussole sûr'>une boussole sûre</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_709.18'><ins class='correction' title='un boussole sûr'>une boussole sûre</ins></a></span> pour
le premier regard d’un étranger qui arrive dans un pays inconnu.”</span><a id='r4.23.3' /><a href='#f4.23.3' class='c013'><sup>[3]</sup></a>
Unfortunately, the habitual seclusion of the higher classes of
females in the East contracts the sphere of observation in regard
to their influence on society; but, to borrow again from our
ingenious author, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“les hommes font les lois, les femmes font
les m&oelig;urs”;</span> and their incarceration in Rajasthan by no means
lessens the application of the adage to that country. Like the
magnetic power, however latent, their attraction is not the less
certain. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“C’est aux hommes à faire des grandes choses, c’est
aux femmes à les inspirer,”</span> is a maxim to which every Rajput
cavalier would subscribe, with whom the age of chivalry is not
fled, though ages of oppression have passed over him. He knows
there is no retreat into which the report of a gallant action will
not penetrate, and set fair hearts in motion to be the object of
his search. The bards, those chroniclers of fame, like the Jongleurs
of old, have everywhere access, to the palace as to the hamlet;
and a brilliant exploit travels with all the rapidity of a comet,
and clothed with the splendid decorations of poetry, from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_710'>710</span>Indian desert to the valley of the Jumna. If we cannot paint
the Rajput dame as invested with all the privileges which Ségur
assigns to the first woman, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“compagne de l’homme et son égale,
vivant par lui, pour lui, associée à son bonheur, à ses plaisirs,
à la puissance qu’il exerçait sur ce vaste univers,”</span> she is
far removed from the condition which demands commiseration
[610].</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Seclusion of Women.</h4>—Like the ancient German or Scandinavian,
the Rajput consults her in every transaction; from her
ordinary actions he draws the omen of success, and he appends
to her name the epithet of <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>devi</em></span>, or ‘godlike.’ The superficial
observer, who applies his own standard to the customs of all
nations, laments with an affected philanthropy the degraded
condition of the Hindu female, in which sentiment he would find
her little disposed to join. He particularly laments her want of
liberty, and calls her seclusion imprisonment. Although I
cordially unite with Ségur, who is at issue with his compatriot
Montesquieu on this part of discipline, yet from the knowledge
I do possess of the freedom, the respect, the happiness, which
Rajput women enjoy, I am by no means inclined to deplore
their state as one of captivity. The author of the <cite>Spirit of Laws</cite>,
with the views of a closet philosopher, deems seclusion necessary
from the irresistible influence of climate on the passions; while
the chivalrous Ségur, with more knowledge of human nature,
draws the very opposite conclusion, asserting all restraints to
be injurious to morals. Of one thing we are certain, seclusion
of females could only originate in a moderately advanced stage
of civilization. Amongst hunters, pastors, and cultivators, the
women were required to aid in all external pursuits, as well as
internal economy. The Jews secluded not their women, and
the well, where they assembled to draw water, was the place
where marriages were contracted, as with the lower classes in
Rajputana. The inundations of the Nile, each house of whose
fertile valleys was isolated, is said to have created habits of
secluding women with the Egyptians; and this argument might
apply to the vast valleys of the Indus and Ganges first inhabited,
and which might have diffused example with the spread of population.
Assuredly, if India was colonized from the cradle of nations,
Central Asia, they did not thence bring these notions within the
Indus; for the Scythian women went to the opposite extreme,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_711'>711</span>and were polyandrists.<a id='r4.23.4' /><a href='#f4.23.4' class='c013'><sup>[4]</sup></a> The desire of eradicating those impure
habits, described by Herodotus, that the slipper at the tent-door
should no longer be a sign, may have originated the opposite
extreme in a life of entire seclusion. Both polygamy and polyandry
originated in a mistaken view of the animal economy,
and of the first great command to people the earth: the one
was general amongst all the nations [611] of antiquity; the
other rare, though to be found in Scythia, India, and even amongst
the Natchez, in the new world; but never with the Rajput, with
whom monogamy existed during the patriarchal ages of India,
as amongst the Egyptians.<a id='r4.23.5' /><a href='#f4.23.5' class='c013'><sup>[5]</sup></a> Of all the nations of the world who
have habituated the female to a restricted intercourse with
society, whether Grecian, Roman, Egyptian, or Chinese, the
Rajput has given least cause to provoke the sentiment of pity;
for if deference and respect be proofs of civilization, Rajputana
must be considered as redundant in evidence of it. The uxoriousness
of the Rajput might be appealed to as indicative of the
decay of national morals; “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chez les barbares</span> (says Ségur) <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les
femmes ne sont rien: les m&oelig;urs de ces peuples s’adoucissent-t’-elles,
on compte les femmes pour quelque chose: enfin, se
corrompent-elles, les femmes sont tout</span>”; and whether from this
decay, or the more probable and amiable cause of seeking, in
their society, consolation for the loss of power and independence,
the women are nearly everything with the Rajput.</div>

<p class='c001'>It is scarcely fair to quote Manu as an authority for the proper
treatment of the fair sex, since many of his dicta by no means
tend to elevate their condition. In his lengthened catalogue of
things pure and impure he says, however, “The mouth of a

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Chief of Sādri and his Wife.</h4>—In the most tempestuous
period of the history of Mewar, when the Ranas broke asunder
the bonds which united them to the other chiefs of Rajasthan,
and bestowed their daughters on the foreign nobles incorporated
with the higher class of their own kin, the chief of Sadri, so often
mentioned, had obtained a princess to wife. There was a hazard
to domestic happiness in such unequal alliance, which the lord
<span class='pageno' id='Page_713'>713</span>of Sadri soon experienced. To the courteous request, “Ranawatji,
fill me a cup of water,” he received a contemptuous refusal,
with the remark, that “The daughter of a hundred kings would
not become cup-bearer to the chieftain of Sadri.”—“Very well,”
replied the plain soldier, “you may return to your father’s house,
if you can be of no use in mine.” A messenger was instantly
sent to the court, and the message, with every aggravation, was
made known; and she followed on the heels of her messenger.
A summons soon arrived for the Sadri chief to attend his sovereign
at the capital. He obeyed; and arrived in time to give his
explanation just as the Rana was proceeding to hold a full court.
As usual, the Sadri chief was placed on his sovereign’s right hand,
and when the court broke up, the heir-apparent of Mewar, at a
preconcerted sign, stood at the edge of the carpet, performing
the menial office of holding the slippers of the chief. Shocked
at such a mark of extreme respect, he stammered forth some
words of homage, his unworthiness, etc.; to which the Rana
replied, “As my son-in-law, no distinction too great can be
conferred: take home your wife, she will never again refuse
you a cup of water” [613].<a id='r4.23.10' /><a href='#f4.23.10' class='c013'><sup>[10]</sup></a></div>

Nor will the annals of any nation afford more numerous or more
sublime instances of female devotion, than those of the Rajputs;
and such would never have been recorded, were not the incentive
likely to be revered and followed. How easy would it be to cite
examples for every passion which can actuate the human mind!
Do we desire to see a model of unbounded devotion, resignation,
and love, let us take the picture of Sita, as painted by the Milton
of their silver age, than which nothing more beautiful or sentimental
may be culled even from Paradise Lost. Rama was
about to abandon his faithful wife for the purpose of becoming
a Vana-prastha or hermit, when she thus pours out her ardent
desire to partake of his solitude.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Tale of Dewaldai.</h4>—The annals of no nation on earth record
a more ennobling or more magnanimous instance of female
loyalty than that exemplified by Dewaldai, mother of the
Bannaphar brothers, which will at once illustrate the manners
of the Rajput fair, and their estimation and influence in society.</div>

<p class='c001'>The last Hindu emperor of Delhi, the chivalrous Prithiraj of
the Chauhan race, had abducted the daughter of the prince of
Sameta. Some of the wounded who had covered his retreat
were assailed and put to death by Parmal, the Chandel prince of
Mahoba.<a id='r4.23.12' /><a href='#f4.23.12' class='c013'><sup>[12]</sup></a> In order to avenge this insult, the emperor had no
sooner conveyed his bride to Delhi than he invaded the territory
of the Chandel, whose troops were cut to pieces at Sirswa,<a id='r4.23.13' /><a href='#f4.23.13' class='c013'><sup>[13]</sup></a> the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_716'>716</span>advanced post of his kingdom. While [615] pursuing his success,
the Chandel called a council, and by the advice of his queen
Malandevi demanded a truce of his adversary, on the plea of the
absence of his chieftains Alha and Udala. The brother of the
bard of Mahoba was the envoy, who found the Chauhan ready
to cross the Pahuj. He presented his gifts, and adjured him,
“as a true Rajput, not to take them at such disadvantage.”
The gifts were accepted, and the Chauhan pledged himself, “albeit
his warriors were eager for the fight,” to grant the truce demanded;
and having dismissed the herald, he inquired of his own bard, the
prophetic Chand, the cause of the disaffection which led to the
banishment of the Bannaphar; to which he thus replies: “Jasraj
was the leader of the armies of Mahoba when his sovereign was
defeated and put to flight by the wild race of Gonds; Jasraj
repulsed the foe, captured Garha their capital, and laid his head
at his sovereign’s feet. Parmal returning with victory to Mahoba,
in gratitude for his service, embraced the sons of Jasraj, and
placed them in his honours and lands, while Malandevi the queen
made no distinction between them and her son.” The fief of
the young Bannaphar<a id='r4.23.14' /><a href='#f4.23.14' class='c013'><sup>[14]</sup></a> chieftains was at the celebrated fortress
Kalanjar, where their sovereign happening to see a fine mare
belonging to Alha, desired to possess her, and being refused, so
far forgot past services as to compel them to abandon the country.
On retiring they fired the estates of the Parihara chief who had
instigated their disgrace. With their mother and families they
repaired to Kanauj, whose monarch received them with open
arms, assigning lands for their maintenance. Having thus
premised the cause of banishment, Chand conducts us to Kanauj,
at the moment when Jagnakh the bard was addressing the exiles
on the dangers of Mahoba.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>War with Prithirāj.</h4>—“The Chauhan is encamped on the
plains of Mahoba; Narsingh and Birsingh have fallen, Sirswa is
given to the flames, and the kingdom of Parmal laid waste by
the Chauhan. For one month a truce has been obtained: while
to you I am sent for aid in his griefs. Listen, O sons of Bannaphar;
sad have been the days of Malandevi since you left Mahoba!
Oft she looks towards Kanauj; and while she recalls you to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_717'>717</span>mind, tears gush from her eyes and she exclaims, ‘The fame of
the Chandel is departing’; but when gone, O sons of Jasraj,
great will be your self-accusing sorrow: yet, think of Mahoba.”</div>

<p class='c001'>“Destruction to Mahoba! Annihilation to the Chandel who,
without fault [616], expelled us our home: in whose service fell
our father, by whom his kingdom was extended. Send the
slanderous Parihara—let him lead your armies against the heroes
of Delhi. Our heads were the pillars of Mahoba; by us were
the Gonds expelled, and their strongholds Deogarh and Chandbari
added to his sway. We maintained the field against the Jadon,
sacked Hindaun,<a id='r4.23.15' /><a href='#f4.23.15' class='c013'><sup>[15]</sup></a> and planted his standard on the plains of
Katehr.<a id='r4.23.16' /><a href='#f4.23.16' class='c013'><sup>[16]</sup></a> It was I (continued Alha) who stopped the sword of
the conquering Kachhwaha<a id='r4.23.17' /><a href='#f4.23.17' class='c013'><sup>[17]</sup></a>—The amirs of the Sultan fled
before us.—At Gaya we were victorious, and added Rewa<a id='r4.23.18' /><a href='#f4.23.18' class='c013'><sup>[18]</sup></a> to
his kingdom. Antarved<a id='r4.23.19' /><a href='#f4.23.19' class='c013'><sup>[19]</sup></a> I gave to the flames, and levelled to
the ground the towns of Mewat.<a id='r4.23.20' /><a href='#f4.23.20' class='c013'><sup>[20]</sup></a> From ten princes did Jasraj
bring spoil to Mahoba. This have we done; and the reward is
exile from our home! Seven times have I received wounds in
his service, and since my father’s death gained forty battles;
and from seven has Udala conveyed the record of victory<a id='r4.23.21' /><a href='#f4.23.21' class='c013'><sup>[21]</sup></a> to
Parmal. Thrice my death seemed inevitable. The honour of
his house I have upheld—yet exile is my reward!”</p>

<p class='c001'>The bard replies—“The father of Parmal left him when a
child to the care of Jasraj. Your father was in lieu of his own;
the son should not abandon him when misfortune makes him call
on you. The Rajput who abandons his sovereign in distress will
be plunged into hell. Then place on your head the loyalty of
your father. Can you desire to remain at Kanauj while he is in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_718'>718</span>trouble, who expended thousands in rejoicings for your birth?
Malandevi (the queen), who loves you as her own, presses your
return. She bids me demand of Dewaldai fulfilment of the oft-repeated
vow, that your life and Mahoba, when endangered, were
inseparable. The breaker of vows, despised on earth, will be
plunged into hell, there to remain while sun and moon endure.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Dewaldai heard the message of the queen. “Let us fly to
Mahoba,” she [617] exclaimed. Alha was silent, while Udala said
aloud, “May evil spirits seize upon Mahoba!—Can we forget
the day when, in distress, he drove us forth?—Return to Mahoba—let
it stand or fall, it is the same to me; Kanauj is henceforth
my home.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Would that the gods had made me barren,” said Dewaldai,
“that I had never borne sons who thus abandon the paths of
the Rajput, and refuse to succour their prince in danger!” Her
heart bursting with grief, and her eyes raised to heaven, she
continued: “Was it for this, O universal lord, thou mad’st me
feel a mother’s pangs for these destroyers of Bannaphar’s fame?
Unworthy offspring! the heart of the true Rajput dances with
joy at the mere name of strife—but ye, degenerate, cannot be
the sons of Jasraj—some carl must have stolen to my embrace,
and from such ye must be sprung.” The young chiefs arose,
their faces withered in sadness. “When we perish in defence
of Mahoba, and covered with wounds, perform deeds that will
leave a deathless name; when our heads roll in the field—when
we embrace the valiant in fight, and treading in the footsteps
of the brave, make resplendent the blood of both lines, even in
the presence of the heroes of the Chauhan, then will our mother
rejoice.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The envoy having, by this loyal appeal of Dewaldai, attained
the object of his mission, the brothers repair to the monarch of
Kanauj,<a id='r4.23.22' /><a href='#f4.23.22' class='c013'><sup>[22]</sup></a> in order to ask permission to return to Mahoba; this
is granted, and they are dismissed with magnificent gifts, in which
the bardic herald participated;<a id='r4.23.23' /><a href='#f4.23.23' class='c013'><sup>[23]</sup></a> and the parting valediction was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_719'>719</span>“preserve the faith of the Rajputs.” The omens during the
march were of the worst kind: as Jagnakh expounded them,
Alha with a smile replied, “O bard, though thou canst dive into
the dark recesses of futurity, to the brave all omens are happy,<a id='r4.23.24' /><a href='#f4.23.24' class='c013'><sup>[24]</sup></a>
even though our heroes shall fall, and the fame of the Chandel
must depart; thus in secret does my soul assure me.” The
saras<a id='r4.23.25' /><a href='#f4.23.25' class='c013'><sup>[25]</sup></a> was alone on the right—the eagle as he flew dropped his
prey—the chakwa<a id='r4.23.26' /><a href='#f4.23.26' class='c013'><sup>[26]</sup></a> <a id='corr719.8'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='separated'>“separated</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_719.8'><ins class='correction' title='separated'>“separated</ins></a></span> from his mate—drops fell from
the eyes of the warlike steed—the siyal<a id='r4.23.27' /><a href='#f4.23.27' class='c013'><sup>[27]</sup></a> sent forth sounds of
lamentation; spots were seen on the disc of the sun” [618].
The countenance of Lakhan fell;<a id='r4.23.28' /><a href='#f4.23.28' class='c013'><sup>[28]</sup></a> these portents filled his soul
with dismay: but Alha said, “though these omens bode death,
yet death to the valiant, to the pure in faith, is an object of desire
not of sorrow. The path of the Rajput is beset with difficulties,
rugged, and filled with thorns; but he regards it not, so it but
conducts to battle.”—“To carry joy to Parmala alone occupied
their thoughts: the steeds bounded over the plain like the swift-footed
deer.” The brothers, ere they reached Mahoba, halted
to put on the saffron robe, the sign of “no quarter” with the
Rajput warrior. The intelligence of their approach filled the
Chandela prince with joy, who advanced to embrace his defenders,
and conduct them to Mahoba; while the queen Malandevi came
to greet Dewaldai, who with the herald bard paid homage, and
returned with the queen to the city. Rich gifts were presented,
gems resplendent with light. The queen sent for Alha, and
extending her hands over his head, bestowed the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>asis</em></span><a id='r4.23.29' /><a href='#f4.23.29' class='c013'><sup>[29]</sup></a> <a id='corr719.26'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='(blessing'>(blessing)</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_719.26'><ins class='correction' title='(blessing'>(blessing)</ins></a></span>
as kneeling he swore his head was with Mahoba, and then waved
a vessel filled with pearls over his head, which were distributed
to his followers.<a id='r4.23.30' /><a href='#f4.23.30' class='c013'><sup>[30]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_720'>720</span>The bardic herald was rewarded with four villages. We are
then introduced to the Chauhan camp and council, where Chand
the bard is expatiating on the return of the Bannaphars with the
succours of Kanauj. He recommends his sovereign to send a
herald to the Chandel to announce the expiration of the truce,
and requiring him to meet him in the field, or abandon Mahoba.
According to the bard’s advice, a dispatch was transmitted to
Parmal, in which the cause of war was recapitulated—the murder
of the wounded; and stating that, according to Rajput faith,
he had granted seven days beyond the time demanded, “and
although so many days had passed since succour had arrived
from Kanauj, the lion-horn had not yet sounded (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>singhnad</em></span>)”:
adding, “if he abandon all desire of combat, let him proclaim
his vassalage to Delhi, and abandon Mahoba.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Parmal received the hostile message in despair; but calling
his warriors around him, he replied to the herald of the Chauhan,
that “on the day of the sun, the first of the month, he would join
him in strife” [619].</p>

<p class='c001'>“On the day sacred to Sukra (Friday), Prithiraj sounded the
shell, while the drums thrice struck proclaimed the truce concluded.<a id='r4.23.31' /><a href='#f4.23.31' class='c013'><sup>[31]</sup></a>
The standard was brought forth, around which the
warriors gathered; the cup circulated, the prospect of battle
filled their souls with joy. They anointed their bodies with
fragrant oils, while the celestial Apsaras with ambrosial oils and
heavenly perfumes anointed their silver forms, tinged their eyelids,
and prepared for the reception of heroes.<a id='r4.23.32' /><a href='#f4.23.32' class='c013'><sup>[32]</sup></a> The sound of the
war-shell reached Kailas; the abstraction of Iswara was at an
end—joy seized his soul at the prospect of completing his chaplet
of skulls (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>mundamala</em></span>). The Yoginis danced with joy, their faces
sparkled with delight, as they seized their vessels to drink the
blood of the slain. The devourers of flesh, the Palankashas, sung
<span class='pageno' id='Page_721'>721</span>songs of triumph at the game of battle between the Chauhan and
Chandel.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In another measure, the bard proceeds to contrast the occupations
of his heroes and the celestials preparatory to the combat,
which descriptions are termed <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>rupaka</em></span>. “The heroes gird on
their armour, while the heavenly fair deck their persons. They
place on their heads the helm crowned with the war-bell (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>viragantha</em></span>),
these adjust the corset; they draw the girths of the war-steed,
the fair of the world of bliss bind the anklet of bells; nets
of steel defend the turban’s fold, they braid their hair with golden
flowers and gems; the warrior polishes his falchion—the fair
tints the eyelid with <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>anjan</em></span>;<a id='r4.23.33' /><a href='#f4.23.33' class='c013'><sup>[33]</sup></a> the hero points his dagger, the fair
paints a heart on her forehead; he braces on his ample buckler—she
places the resplendent orb in her ear; he binds his arms
with a gauntlet of brass—she stains her hands with the henna.
The hero decorates his hand with the tiger-claw<a id='r4.23.34' /><a href='#f4.23.34' class='c013'><sup>[34]</sup></a>—the Apsaras
ornaments with rings and golden bracelets; the warrior shakes
the ponderous lance—the heavenly fair the garland of love<a id='r4.23.35' /><a href='#f4.23.35' class='c013'><sup>[35]</sup></a> to
decorate those who fall in the fight; she binds on a necklace
of pearls, he a <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>mala</em></span> of the tulasi.<a id='r4.23.36' /><a href='#f4.23.36' class='c013'><sup>[36]</sup></a> The warrior strings his
bow—the fair assume their killing [620] glances. Once more
the heroes look to their girths, while the celestial fair prepare
their cars.”</p>

<p class='c001'>After the bard has finished his <cite>rupaka</cite>, he exclaims, “Thus
says Chand, the lord of verse; with my own eyes have I seen
what I describe.” It is important to remark, that the national
faith of the Rajput never questions the prophetic power of their
chief bard, whom they call Trikala, or cognoscent of the past,
the present, and the future—a character which the bard has
enjoyed in all ages and climes; but Chand was the last whom
they admitted to possess supernatural vision.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_722'>722</span>We must now return to Mahoba, where a grand council had
assembled at a final deliberation; at which, shaded by screens,
the mother of the Bannaphars, and the queen Malandevi, were
present. The latter thus opens the debate: “O mother of Alha,
how may we succeed against the lord of the world?<a id='r4.23.37' /><a href='#f4.23.37' class='c013'><sup>[37]</sup></a> If defeated,
lost is Mahoba; if we pay tribute, we are loaded with
shame.” Dewaldai recommends hearing <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>seriatim</em></span> the opinions
of the chieftains, when Alha thus speaks: “Listen, O mother,
to your son; he alone is of pure lineage who, placing loyalty on
his head, abandons all thoughts of self, and lays down his life for
his prince; my thoughts are only for Parmal. If she lives she
will show herself a woman, or emanation of Parvati.<a id='r4.23.38' /><a href='#f4.23.38' class='c013'><sup>[38]</sup></a> The
warriors of Sambhar shall be cut in pieces. I will so illustrate
the blood of my fathers, that my fame shall last for ever. My
son Indal, O prince! I bequeath to you, and the fame of Dewaldai
is in your keeping.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The queen thus replies: “The warriors of the Chauhan are
fierce as they are numerous; pay tribute, and save Mahoba.”
The soul of Udala inflamed, and turning to the queen, “Why
thought you not thus when you slew the defenceless? but then
I was unheard. Whence now your wisdom? thrice I beseeched
you to pardon. Nevertheless, Mahoba is safe while life remains
in me, and in your cause, O Parmal! we shall espouse celestial
brides.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well have you spoken, my son,” said Dewaldai, “nothing
now remains but to make thy parent’s milk resplendent by thy
deeds. The call of the peasant driven [621] from his home meets
the ear, and while we deliberate, our villages are given to the
flames.” But Parmal replied: “Saturn<a id='r4.23.39' /><a href='#f4.23.39' class='c013'><sup>[39]</sup></a> rules the day, to-morrow
we shall meet the foe.” With indignation Alha turned
to the king: “He who can look tamely on while the smoke
ascends from his ruined towns, his fields laid waste, can be no
Rajput—he who succumbs to fear when his country is invaded,
his body will be plunged into the hell of hells, his soul a wanderer
in the world of spirits for sixty thousand years; but the warrior
<span class='pageno' id='Page_723'>723</span>who performs his duty will be received into the mansion of the
sun, and his deeds will last for ever.”</p>

<p class='c001'>But cowardice and cruelty always accompany each other,
nor could all the speeches of the brothers “screw his courage to
the sticking place.” Parmal went to his queen, and gave fresh
vent to his lamentation. She upbraided his unmanly spirit, and
bid him head his troops and go forth to the fight. The heroes
embraced their wives for the last time, and with the dawn performed
their pious rites. The Bannaphar offered oblations to the
nine planets, and having adored the image of his tutelary god,
he again put the chain round his neck;<a id='r4.23.40' /><a href='#f4.23.40' class='c013'><sup>[40]</sup></a> then calling his son
Indal, and Udala his brother, he once more poured forth his vows
to the universal mother “that he would illustrate the name of
Jasraj, and evince the pure blood derived from Dewaldai, whene’er
he met the foe.”—“Nobly have you resolved,” said Udala, “and
shall not my <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>kirwan</em></span><a id='r4.23.41' /><a href='#f4.23.41' class='c013'><sup>[41]</sup></a> also dazzle the eyes of Sambhar’s lord?
shall he not retire from before me?”—“Farewell, my children,”
said Dewaldai, “be true to your salt, and should you lose your
heads for your prince, doubt not you will obtain the celestial
crown.” Having ceased, the wives of both exclaimed, “What
virtuous wife survives her lord? for thus says Gauriji,<a id='r4.23.42' /><a href='#f4.23.42' class='c013'><sup>[42]</sup></a> ‘the
woman, who survives her husband who falls in the field of battle,
will never obtain bliss, but wander a discontented ghost in the
region of unhallowed spirits.’”</p>

<p class='c001'>This is sufficient to exhibit the supreme influence of women,
not only on, but also in society.</p>

<p class='c001'>The extract is taken from the Bardic historian, when Hindu
customs were pure, and the Chauhan was paramount sovereign
of India. It is worth while to compare it with another written
six centuries after the conquest by the Muhammadans; although
six dynasties—namely, Ghazni, Ghor, Khilji [622], Sayyid, Lodi,
and Mogul, numbering more than thirty kings, had intervened,
yet the same uncontrollable spirit was in full force, unchangeable
even in misfortune. Both Hindu and Persian historians expatiate
with delight on the anecdote; but we prefer the narrative of the
ingenuous Bernier, under whose eye the incident occurred.</p>

<div class='section-start'><span class='pageno' id='Page_724'>724</span><h4 class='disp-inline'>Jaswant Singh and his Wife.</h4>—In the civil war for empire
amongst the sons of Shah Jahan, when Aurangzeb opened his
career by the deposal of his father and the murder of his brothers,
the Rajputs, faithful to the emperor, determined to oppose him.
Under the intrepid Rathor Jaswant Singh, thirty thousand
Rajputs, chiefly of that clan, advanced to the Nerbudda, and with
a magnanimity amounting to imprudence, they permitted the
junction of Murad with Aurangzeb, who, under cover of artillery
served by Frenchmen, crossed the river almost unopposed.
Next morning the action commenced, which continued throughout
the day. The Rajputs behaved with their usual bravery;
but were surrounded on all sides, and by sunset left ten thousand
dead on the field.<a id='r4.23.43' /><a href='#f4.23.43' class='c013'><sup>[43]</sup></a> The Maharaja retreated to his own country,
but his wife, a daughter of the Rana of Udaipur, “disdained (says
Ferishta) to receive her lord, and shut the gates of the castle.”</div>

<p class='c001'>Bernier, who was present, says, “I cannot forbear to relate
the fierce reception which the daughter of the Rana gave to her
husband Jeswunt Singh [Jessom Seingue], after his defeat and
flight. When she heard he was nigh, and had understood what
had passed in the battle; that he had fought with all possible
courage; that he had but four or five hundred men left; and at
last, no longer able to resist the enemy, had been forced to retreat;
instead of sending some one to condole him in his misfortunes,
she commanded in a dry mood to shut the gates of the castle, and
not to let this infamous man enter; that he was not her husband;
that the son-in-law of the great Rana could not have so mean a
soul; that he was to remember, that being grafted into so
illustrious a house, he was to imitate its virtue; in a word, he
was to vanquish, or to die. A moment after, she was of another
humour; she commands a pile of wood to be laid, that she might
<span class='pageno' id='Page_725'>725</span>burn herself; that they abused her; that her husband must
needs be dead; that it could not be otherwise. And a little
while after, she was seen to change countenance, to [623] fall into
a passion, and break into a thousand reproaches against him. In
short, she remained thus transported eight or nine days, without
being able to resolve to see her husband, till at last her mother
coming, brought her in time to herself, composed by assuring her
that as soon as the Raja had but refreshed himself he would raise
another army to fight Aurangzeb, and repair his honour. By
which story one may see,” says Bernier, “a pattern of the
courage of the women in that country”; and he adds this philosophical
corollary on this and the custom of satis, which he had
witnessed: “There is nothing which opinion, prepossession,
custom, hope, and the point of honour, may not make men do or
suffer.”<a id='r4.23.44' /><a href='#f4.23.44' class='c013'><sup>[44]</sup></a></p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Tale of Sanjogta.</h4>—The romantic history of the Chauhan
emperor of Delhi abounds in sketches of female character; and
in the story of his carrying off Sanjogta, the princess of Kanauj,
we have not only the individual portrait of the Helen of her
country, but in it a faithful picture of the sex. We see her, from
the moment when, rejecting the assembled princes, she threw the
“garland of marriage” round the neck of her hero, the Chauhan,
abandon herself to all the influences of passion—mix in a combat
of five days’ continuance against her father’s array, witness his
overthrow, and the carnage of both armies, and subsequently,
by her seductive charms, lulling her lover into a neglect of every
princely duty. Yet when the foes of his glory and power invade
India, we see the enchantress at once start from her trance of
pleasure, and exchanging the softer for the sterner passions, in
accents not less strong because mingled with deep affection, she
conjures him, while arming him for the battle, to die for his fame,
declaring that she will join him in “the mansions of the sun.”
Though it is difficult to extract, in passages sufficiently condensed,
what may convey a just idea of this heroine, we shall attempt it
in the bard’s own language, rendered into prose. He announces
the tidings of invasion by the medium of a dream, which the
Chauhan thus relates:</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_726'>726</span>“‘This night, while in the arms of sleep, a fair, beautiful as
Rambha, rudely seized my arm; then she assailed you, and
while you were struggling, a mighty elephant,<a id='r4.23.45' /><a href='#f4.23.45' class='c013'><sup>[45]</sup></a> infuriated, and
hideous as a demon, bore down upon me. Sleep fled—nor
Rambha nor demon remained—but my heart was panting, and
[624] my quivering lips muttering <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>Har! Har!</em></span><a id='r4.23.46' /><a href='#f4.23.46' class='c013'><sup>[46]</sup></a> What is decreed
the gods only know.’</p>

<p class='c001'>“Sanjogta replied, ‘Victory and fame to my lord! O, sun
of the Chauhans, in glory, or in pleasure, who has tasted so deeply
as you? To die is the destiny not only of man but of the gods:
all desire to throw off the old garment; but to die well is to live
for ever. Think not of self, but of immortality; let your sword
divide your foe, and I will be your <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>ardhanga</em></span><a id='r4.23.47' /><a href='#f4.23.47' class='c013'><sup>[47]</sup></a> hereafter.’</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='corr726.14'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='The'>“The</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_726.14'><ins class='correction' title='The'>“The</ins></a></span> king sought the bard, who expounded the dream, and the
Guru wrote an incantation, which he placed in his turban. A
thousand brass vessels of fresh milk were poured in libations to
the sun and moon. Ten buffaloes were sacrificed to the supporters
of the globe, and gifts were made to all. But will offerings of
blood or libations of milk arrest what is decreed? If by these
man could undo what is ordained, would Nala or the Pandus
have suffered as they did?”</p>

<p class='c001'>While the warriors assemble in council to consult on the best
mode of opposing the Sultan of Ghazni, the king leaves them to
deliberate, in order to advise with Sanjogta. Her reply is
curious:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Who asks woman for advice? The world deems their
understanding shallow; even when truths issue from their lips,
none listen thereto. Yet what is the world without woman?
We have the forms of Sakti<a id='r4.23.48' /><a href='#f4.23.48' class='c013'><sup>[48]</sup></a> with the fire of Siva; we are at once
thieves and sanctuaries; we are vessels of virtue and of vice—of
knowledge and of ignorance. The man of wisdom, the
astrologer, can from the books calculate the motion and course
of the planets; but in the book of woman he is ignorant: and
this is not a saying of to-day, it ever has been so: our book has
not been mastered, therefore, to hide their ignorance, they say,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_727'>727</span>in woman there is no wisdom! Yet woman shares your joys and
your sorrows. Even when you depart from the mansion of the
sun, we part not. Hunger and thirst we cheerfully partake with
you; we are as the lakes, of which you are the swans; what are
when absent from our bosoms?”</p>

<p class='c001'>The army having assembled, and all being prepared to march
against the Islamite, in the last great battle which subjugated
India, the fair Sanjogta armed her lord for the encounter. <a id='corr727.8'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='“In'>In</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_727.8'><ins class='correction' title='“In'>In</ins></a></span>
vain she sought the rings of his corslet; her eyes were [625] fixed
on the face of the Chauhan, as those of the famished wretch who
finds a piece of gold. The sound of the drum reached the ear of
the Chauhan; it was as a death-knell on that of Sanjogta: and
as he left her to head Delhi’s heroes, she vowed that henceforward
water only should sustain her. “I shall see him again in the
region of Surya, but never more in Yoginipur.”<a id='r4.23.49' /><a href='#f4.23.49' class='c013'><sup>[49]</sup></a> Her prediction
was fulfilled: her lord was routed, made captive and slain; and,
faithful to her vow, she mounted the funeral pyre.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Queen of Ganor.</h4>—Were we called upon to give a pendant
for Lucretia, it would be found in the queen of Ganor.<a id='r4.23.50' /><a href='#f4.23.50' class='c013'><sup>[50]</sup></a> After
having defended five fortresses against the foe, she retreated to
her last stronghold on the Nerbudda, and had scarcely left the
bark, when the assailants arrived in pursuit. The disheartened
defenders were few in number, and the fortress was soon in
possession of the foe, the founder of the family now ruling in
Bhopal. The beauty of the queen of Ganor was an allurement
only secondary to his desire for her country, and he invited her
to reign over it and him. Denial would have been useless, and
would have subjected her to instant coercion, for the Khan
awaited her reply in the hall below; she therefore sent a message
of assent, with a complimentary reflection on his gallant conduct
and determination of pursuit; adding, that he merited her hand
for his bravery, and might prepare for the nuptials, which should
be celebrated on the terrace of the palace. She demanded two
hours for unmolested preparation, that she might appear in
appropriate attire, and with the distinction her own and his rank
demanded.</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_728'>728</span>Ceremonials, on a scale of magnificence equal to the shortness
of the time, were going on. The song of joy had already stifled
the discordant voice of war, and at length the Khan was summoned
to the terrace. Robed in the marriage garb presented to him by
the queen, with a necklace and aigrette of superb jewels from the
coffers of Ganor, he hastened to obey the mandate, and found that
fame had not done justice to her charms. He was desired to be
seated, and in conversation full of rapture on his side, hours were
as minutes while he gazed on the beauty of the queen. But
presently his countenance fell—he complained of heat; punkas
and water were brought, but they availed him not, and he began
to tear the bridal garments from his frame, when the queen thus
addressed him [626]: “Know, Khan, that your last hour is
come; our wedding and our death shall be sealed together. The
vestments which cover you are poisoned; you had left me no
other expedient to escape pollution.” While all were horror-struck
by this declaration, she sprung from the battlements into
the flood beneath. The Khan died in extreme torture, and was
buried on the road to Bhopal; and, strange to say, a visit to his
grave has the reputation of curing the tertian of that country.<a id='r4.23.51' /><a href='#f4.23.51' class='c013'><sup>[51]</sup></a></p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Rāja Jai Singh and his Wife.</h4>—We may give another anecdote
illustrative of this extreme delicacy of sentiment, but without
so tragical a conclusion. The celebrated Raja Jai Singh of Amber
<span class='pageno' id='Page_729'>729</span>had espoused a princess of Haraoti, whose manners and garb,
accordant with the simplicity of that provincial capital, subjected
her to the badinage of the more refined court of Amber,
whose ladies had added the imperial costume to their own native
dress. One day being alone with the prince, he began playfully
to contrast the sweeping jupe of Kotah with the more scanty
robe of the belles of his own capital; and taking up a pair of
scissors, said he would reduce it to an equality with the latter.
Offended at such levity, she seized his sword, and assuming a
threatening attitude, said, “that in the house to which she had
the honour to belong, they were not habituated to jests of this
nature; that mutual respect was the guardian, not only of
happiness but of virtue”; and she assured him, that if he ever
again so insulted her, he would find that the daughter of Kotah
could use a sword more effectively than the prince of Amber the
scissors; adding, that she would prevent any future scion of
her house from being subjected to similar disrespect, by declaring
such intermarriages <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>talak</em></span>, or forbidden, which interdict I believe
yet exists.<a id='r4.23.52' /><a href='#f4.23.52' class='c013'><sup>[52]</sup></a></div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>A Courageous Rājput Woman.</h4>—I will append an anecdote
related by the celebrated Zalim Singh, characteristic of the
presence of mind, prowess, and physical strength of the Rajput
women. To attend and aid in the minutiae of husbandry is by
no means uncommon with them, as to dress and carry the meals
of their husbands to the fields is a general practice. In the jungle
which skirts the knolls of Pachpahar, a huge bear assaulted a
Rajputni as she was carrying her husband’s dinner. As he
approached with an air of gallantry upon his hind-legs, doubting
whether the food or herself [627] were the intended prey, she
retreated behind a large tree, round the trunk of which Bruin,
still in his erect attitude, tried all his powers of circumvention
to seize her. At length, half exhausted, she boldly grasped his
paws, and with so vigorous a hold that he roared with pain, while
in vain, with his short neck, did he endeavour to reach the powerful
hand which fixed him. While she was in this dilemma, a
Pardesi (a foreign soldier of the State) happened to be passing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_730'>730</span>to the garrison of Gagraun, and she called out to him in a voice
of such unconcern to come and release her for a time, that he
complied without hesitation. She had not retired, however,
above a dozen yards ere he called loudly for her return, being
scarcely able to hold his new friend; but laughingly recommending
perseverance, she hastened on, and soon returned with her
husband, who laid the monster prostrate with his matchlock,
and rescued the Pardesi from his unpleasing predicament.<a id='r4.23.53' /><a href='#f4.23.53' class='c013'><sup>[53]</sup></a></div>

<p class='c001'>Such anecdotes might be multiplied <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>ad infinitum</em></span>; but I will
conclude with one displaying the romantic chivalry of the Rajput,
and the influence of the fair in the formation of character; it
is taken from the annals of Jaisalmer, the most remote of the
States of Rajasthan, and situated in the heart of the desert, of
which it is an oasis.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Wedding of Sādhu.</h4>—Raningdeo was lord of Pugal, a fief
of Jaisalmer; his heir, named Sadhu, was the terror of the
desert, carrying his raids even to the valley of the Indus, and on
the east to Nagor. Returning from a foray, with a train of
captured camels and horses, he passed by Aurint, where dwelt
Manik Rao, the chief of the Mohils, whose rule extended over
1440 villages. Being invited to partake of the hospitality of
the Mohil, the heir of Pugal attracted the favourable regards of
the old chieftain’s daughter:</div>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>She loved him for the dangers he had passed;</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>for he had the fame of being the first riever of the desert. Although
betrothed to the heir of the Rathor of Mandor, she signified
her wish to renounce the throne to be the bride of the chieftain
of Pugal; and in spite of the dangers he provoked, and contrary
to the Mohil chief’s advice, Sadhu, as a gallant Rajput, dared
not reject the overture, and he promised “to accept the coco,”<a id='r4.23.54' /><a href='#f4.23.54' class='c013'><sup>[54]</sup></a>
if sent in form to Pugal [628]. In due time it came, and the
nuptials were solemnized at Aurint. The dower was splendid;
gems of high price, vessels of gold and silver, a golden bull, and a
train of thirteen <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>dewadharis</em></span>,<a id='r4.23.55' /><a href='#f4.23.55' class='c013'><sup>[55]</sup></a> or damsels of wisdom and penetration.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_731'>731</span>Arankanwal, the slighted heir of Mandor, determined on
revenge, and with four thousand Rathors planted himself in
the path of Sadhu’s return, aided by the Sankhla Mehraj, whose
son Sadhu had slain. Though entreated to add four thousand
Mohils to his escort, Sadhu deemed his own gallant band of seven
hundred Bhattis sufficient to convey his bride to his desert abode,
and with difficulty accepted fifty, led by Meghraj, the brother
of the bride.</p>

<p class='c001'>The rivals encountered at Chondan, where Sadhu had halted
to repose; but the brave Rathor scorned the advantage of
numbers, and a series of single combats ensued, with all the forms
of chivalry. The first who entered the lists was Jaitanga, of
the Pahu clan, and of the kin of Sadhu. The enemy came upon
him by surprise while reposing on the ground, his saddle-cloth
for his couch, and the bridle of his steed twisted round his arm;
he was soon recognized by the Sankhla, who had often encountered
his prowess, on which he expatiated to Arankanwal, who sent an
attendant to awake him; but the gallant Panch Kalyan (for
such was the name of his steed) had already performed this
service, and they found him upbraiding white-legs<a id='r4.23.56' /><a href='#f4.23.56' class='c013'><sup>[56]</sup></a> for treading
upon him. Like a true Rajput, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“<em>toujours prêt</em>,”</span> he received the
hostile message, and sent the envoy back with his compliments,
and a request for some <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>amal</em></span> or opium, as he had lost his own
supply. With all courtesy this was sent, and prepared by the
domestics of his antagonist; after taking which he lay down
to enjoy the customary siesta. As soon as he awoke, he prepared
for the combat, girt on his armour, and having reminded Panch
Kalyan of the fields he had won, and telling him to bear him well
that day, he mounted and advanced. The son of Chonda admiring
his sang-froid, and the address with which he guided his steed,
commanded Jodha Chauhan, the leader of his party, to encounter
the Pahu. “Their two-edged swords soon clashed in combat”;
but the gigantic Chauhan fell beneath the Bhatti, who, warmed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_732'>732</span>with the fight, plunged amidst his foes, encountering all he
deemed worthy of his assault.</p>

<p class='c001'>The fray thus begun, single combats and actions of equal
parties followed, the [629] rivals looking on. At length Sadhu
mounted: twice he charged the Rathor ranks, carrying death
on his lance; each time he returned for the applause of his bride,
who beheld the battle from her car. Six hundred of his foes
had fallen, and nearly half his own warriors. He bade her a last
adieu, while she exhorted him to the fight, saying, “she would
witness his deeds, and if he fell, would follow him even in death.”
Now he singled out his rival Arankanwal,<a id='r4.23.57' /><a href='#f4.23.57' class='c013'><sup>[57]</sup></a> who was alike eager
to end the strife, and blot out his disgrace in his blood. They
met: some seconds were lost in a courteous contention, each
yielding to his rival the first blow, at length dealt out by Sadhu
on the neck of the disappointed Rathor. It was returned with
the rapidity of lightning, and the daughter of the Mohil saw the
steel descend on the head of her lover. Both fell prostrate to
the earth: but Sadhu’s soul had sped; the Rathor had only
swooned. With the fall of the leaders the battle ceased; and
the fair cause of strife, Karamdevi, at once a virgin, a wife, and
a widow, prepared to follow her affianced. Calling for a sword,
with one arm she dissevered the other, desiring it might be conveyed
to the father of her lord—“tell him such was his daughter.”
The other she commanded to be struck off, and given, with her
marriage jewels thereon, to the bard of the Mohils. The pile
was prepared on the field of battle; and taking her lord in her
embrace, she gave herself up to the devouring flames. The dissevered
limbs were disposed of as commanded; the old Rao of
Pugal caused the one to be burnt, and a tank was excavated on
the spot, which is still called after the heroine, “the lake of
Karamdevi.”</p>

<p class='c001'>This encounter took place in S. 1462, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1406. The brunt
of the battle fell on the Sankhlas, and only twenty-five out of
three hundred and fifty left the field with their leader, Mehraj,
himself severely wounded. The rejected lover had four brothers
dangerously hurt; and in six months the wounds of Arankanwal
opened afresh: he died, and the rites to the manes of these rivals

<p class='c001'>Without pausing to trace the moral springs of that devotion
which influenced the Mohila maiden, we shall relate the sequel
to the story (though out of place)<a id='r4.23.60' /><a href='#f4.23.60' class='c013'><sup>[60]</sup></a> in illustration of the prosecution
of feuds throughout Rajasthan. The fathers [630] now took
up the quarrel of their sons; and as it was by the prowess of the
Sankhla vassal of Mandor that the band of Sadhu was discomfited,
the old Rao, Raningdeo, drew together the lances of Pugal, and
carried destruction into the fief of Mehraj. The Sankhlas yield in
valour to none of the brave races who inhabit the “region of
death”; and Mehraj was the father of Harbuji Sankhla, the
Palladin of Marudes, whose exploits are yet the theme of the
erratic bards of Rajasthan. Whether he was unprepared for the
assault, or overcome by numbers, three hundred of his kin and
clan moistened the sand-hills of the Luni with their blood. Raningdeo,
flushed with revenge and laden with spoil, had reached
his own frontier, when he was overtaken by Chonda of Mandor,
alike eager to avenge the loss of his son Arankanwal, and this
destructive inroad on his vassal. A desperate conflict ensued,
in which the Rao of Pugal was slain; and the Rathor returned
in triumph to Mandor.</p>

<p class='c001'>Unequal to cope with the princes of Mandor, the two remaining
sons of Raningdeo, Tana and Mera, resolved to abandon their
faith, in order to preserve the point of honour, and “to take up
their father’s feud.”<a id='r4.23.61' /><a href='#f4.23.61' class='c013'><sup>[61]</sup></a> At this period the king, Khizr Khan,<a id='r4.23.62' /><a href='#f4.23.62' class='c013'><sup>[62]</sup></a>
was at Multan; to him they went, and by offers of service and
an open apostacy, obtained a force to march against Chonda,
who had recently added Nagor to his growing dominions. While
the brothers were thus negotiating, they were joined by Kilan,
the third son of their common sovereign, the Rawal of Jaisalmer,
who advised the use of <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>chal</em></span>, which with the Rajput means indifferently
stratagem or treachery, so that it facilitates revenge.
With the ostensible motive of ending their feuds, and restoring
tranquillity to their borderers, whose sole occupation was watching,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_734'>734</span>burning, and devastating, Kilan offered a daughter in
marriage to Chonda, and went so far as to say, that if he suspected
aught unfair, he would, though contrary to custom and his own
dignity, send the Bhatti princess to Nagor. This course being
deemed the wisest, Chonda acquiesced in his desire “to extinguish
the feud (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>wair bujhana</em></span>).”</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Nāgor taken by Stratagem.</h4>—Fifty covered chariots were prepared
as the nuptial cortège, but which, instead of the bride and
her handmaids, contained the bravest men of Pugal.<a id='r4.23.63' /><a href='#f4.23.63' class='c013'><sup>[63]</sup></a> These
were preceded by a train of horses led by Rajputs, of whom seven
hundred also attended the camels laden with baggage, provisions,
and gifts, while a small armed [631] retinue brought up the rear.
The king’s troops, amounting to one thousand horse, remained
at a cautious distance behind. Chonda left Nagor to meet the
cavalcade and his bride, and had reached the chariots ere his
suspicions were excited. Observing, however, some matters
which little savoured of festivity, the Rathor commenced his
retreat. Upon this the chiefs rushed from their chariots and
camels, and the royal auxiliaries advancing, Chonda was assailed
and fell at the gate of Nagor; and friend and foe entering the
city together, a scene of general plunder commenced.</div>

<p class='c001'>Once more the feud was balanced; a son and a father had
fallen on each side, and the petty Rao of Pugal had bravely maintained
the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>wair</em></span> against the princes of Mandor. The point of
honour had been carried to the utmost bound by both parties,
and an opportunity of reconciliation was at hand, which prevented
the shadow of disgrace either to him who made or him
who accepted the overture. The Rathors dreaded the loss of
the recent acquisition, Nagor, and proposed to the Bhattis to
seal their pacification with the blood of their common foe. United,
they fell on the spoil-encumbered Tatars, whom they slew to a
man.<a id='r4.23.64' /><a href='#f4.23.64' class='c013'><sup>[64]</sup></a> Their father’s feud thus revenged, the sons of Raningdeo
(who, as apostates from their faith, could no longer hold Pugal
in fief, which was retained by Kilan, who had aided their revenge)
retired amongst the Aboharia Bhattis, and their descendants are
now styled Momin Musalman Bhatti.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_735'>735</span>From such anecdotes it will be obvious wherein consists the
point of honour with the Rajputs; and it is not improbable that
the very cause which has induced an opinion that females can
have no influence on the lords of the creation, namely, their
seclusion, operates powerfully in the contrary way.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Influence of Women on Rājput Society.</h4>—In spite of this
seclusion, the knowledge of their accomplishments and of their
personal perfections, radiates wherever the itinerant bard can
travel. Though invisible themselves, they can see; and accident
often favours public report, and brings the object of renown
within the sphere of personal observation: as in the case of Sadhu
and the Mohila maiden. Placed behind screens, they see the
youths of all countries, and there are occasions when permanent
impressions are made, during tournaments and other martial
exercises. Here we have just seen that the passion of the [632]
daughter of the Mohil was fostered at the risk of the destruction
not only of her father’s house, but also that of her lover; and as
the fourteen hundred and forty towns, which owned the sway
of the former, were not long after absorbed into the accumulating
territory of Mandor, this insult may have been the cause
of the extirpation of the Mohils, as it was of the Bhattis of
Pugal.</div>

<p class='c001'>The influence of women on Rajput society is marked in every
page of Hindu history, from the most remote periods. What
led to the wars of Rama? the rape of Sita. What rendered
deadly the feuds of the Yadus? the insult to Draupadi. What
made prince Nala an exile from Narwar? his love for Damayanti.
What made Raja Bhartari abandon the throne of Avanti? the
loss of Pingali. What subjected the Hindu to the dominion of
the Islamite? the rape of the princess of Kanauj. In fine, the
cause which overturned kingdoms, commuted the sceptre to the
pilgrim’s staff, and formed the groundwork of all their grand
epics, is woman. In ancient, and even in modern times, she had
more than a negative in the choice of a husband, and this choice
fell on the gallant and the gay. The fair Draupadi was the prize
of the best archer, and the Pandu Bhima established his fame,
and bore her from all the suitors of Kampila. The princess of
Kanauj, when led through ranks of the princes of Hind, each
hoping to be the object of her choice, threw the marriage-garland
(<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>barmala</em></span>) over the neck of the effigy of the Chauhan, which her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_736'>736</span>father in derision had placed as porter at the gate. Here was
incense to fame and incentive to gallantry!<a id='r4.23.65' /><a href='#f4.23.65' class='c013'><sup>[65]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In the same manner, as related in another part of this work,
did the princess of Kishangarh invite Rana Raj Singh to bear her
from the impending union with the emperor of the Moguls; and
abundant other instances could be adduced of the free agency
of these invisibles.</p>

<p class='c001'>It were superfluous to reason on the effects of traditional
histories, such as these, on the minds and manners of the females of
Rajasthan. They form the amusement of their lives, and the
grand topic in all their conversaziones; they read them with
the Purohit, and they have them sung by the itinerant bard or
Dholi minstrel [633], who disseminates them wherever the Rajput
name extends. The Rajput mother claims her full share in the
glory of her son, who imbibes at the maternal fount his first
rudiments of chivalry; and the importance of this parental
instruction cannot be better illustrated than in the ever-recurring
simile, “make thy mother’s milk resplendent”; the full force
of which we have in the powerful, though overstrained expression
of the Bundi queen’s joy on the announcement of the heroic
death of her son: “the long-dried fountain at which he fed,
jetted forth as she listened to the tale of his death, and the marble
pavement, on which it fell, rent asunder.” Equally futile would
it be to reason on the intensity of sentiment thus implanted in
the infant Rajput, of whom we may say without metaphor, the
shield is his cradle, and daggers his playthings; and with whom
the first commandment is, “avenge thy father’s feud”; on
which they can heap text upon text, from the days of the great
Pandu moralist Vyasa to the not less influential bard of their
nation, the Trikala Chand.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r4.23.9'>9</a>. Of all the religions which have diversified mankind, whatever man
might select, woman should choose the Christian. This alone gives her
just rank in the scale of creation, whether arising from the demotic principle
which pervades our faith, or the dignity conferred on the sex in being
chosen to be the mother of the Saviour of man. In turning over the pages
of Manu we find many mortifying texts, which I am inclined to regard as
interpolations; as the following, so opposed to the beautiful sentiment
above quoted: “A wife, a son, a servant, a pupil, and a younger brother,
may be corrected when they commit faults with a rope, or the small thong
of a cane” [viii. 299]. Such texts might lead us to adopt Ségur’s conclusions,
that ever since the days of the patriarchs women were only brilliant
slaves—victims, who exhibited, in the wreaths and floral coronets which
bedecked them, the sacrifices to which they were destined. In the
patriarchal ages their occupations were to season the viands, and bake the
bread, and weave cloth for the tents: their recreations limited to respire
the fresh evening air under the shade of a fig tree, and sing canticles to the
Almighty. Such a fate, indeed, must appear to a Parisian dame, who
passes her time between the Feydeau and Tivoli, and whose daily promenade
is through the Champs Élysées, worse than death: yet there is no positive
hardships in these employments, and it was but the fair division of labour
in the primitive ages, and that which characterizes the Rajputni of the
present day.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f4.23.10'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r4.23.10'>10</a>. Manu lays down some plain and wholesome rules for the domestic
conduct of the wife; above all, he recommends her to “preserve a cheerful
temper,” and “frugality in domestic expenses” [<cite>Laws</cite>, v. 150]. Some
of his texts savour, however, more of the anchorite than of a person conversant
with mankind; and when he commands the husband to be reverenced
as a god by the virtuous wife, even though enamoured of another woman,
it may be justly doubted if ever he found obedience thereto; or the scarcely
less difficult ordinance, “for a whole year let a husband bear with his wife
who treats him with aversion,” after which probation he is permitted to
separate [ix. 77]. It is very likely the Rajputs are more in the habit of
quoting the first of these texts than of hearing the last: for although they
have a choice at home, they are not ashamed to be the avowed admirers
of the Aspasias and Phrynes of the capital; from the same cause which
attracted Socrates and made Pericles a slave and which will continue until
the united charms of the dance and the song are sanctioned to be practised

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Immolation of Women.</h4>—We now proceed to consider
another trait of Rajput character, exemplified in the practice of
female immolation, and to inquire whether religion, custom, or
affection has most share in such sacrifice. To arrive at the
origin of this rite, we must trace it to the recesses of mythology,
where we shall discover the precedent in the example of Sati,
who to avenge an insult to Iswara, in her own father’s omission
to ask her lord to an entertainment, consumed herself in the
presence of the assembled gods. With this act of fealty (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>sati</em></span>)
the name of Daksha’s daughter has been identified; and her
regeneration and reunion to her husband, as the mountain-nymph
Mena, or Parvati, furnish the incentive to similar [634] acts.
In the history of these celestial beings, the Rajputni has a memorable
lesson before her, that no domestic differences can afford
exemption from this proof of faith: for Jupiter and Juno were
not more eminent examples of connubial discord than Mena and
Siva, who was not only alike unfaithful, but more cruel, driving
Mena from his Olympus (Kailas), and forcing her to seek refuge
in the murky caverns of Caucasus. Female immolation, therefore,
originated with the sun-worshipping Saivas, and was common
to all those nations who adored this the most splendid object of
the visible creation. Witness the Scythic Gete or Jat warrior of
the Jaxartes, who devoted his wife, horse, arms, and slaves, to
the flames; the “giant Gete” of Scandinavia, who forgot not
on the shores of the Baltic his Transoxianian habits; and the
Frisian Frank and Saxon descended from him, who ages after
omitted only the female. Could we assign the primary cause
of a custom so opposed to the first law of nature with the same
certainty that we can prove its high antiquity, we might be
enabled to devise some means for its abolition. The chief characteristic
of Satiism is its expiating quality: for by this act of
faith, the Sati not only makes atonement for the sins of her
husband, and secures the remission of her own, but has the joyful
assurance of reunion to the object whose beatitude she procures.
Having once imbibed this doctrine, its fulfilment is powerfully
aided by that heroism of character inherent to the Rajputni;
though we see that the stimulant of religion requires no aid even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_738'>738</span>in the timid female of Bengal, who, relying on the promise of
regeneration, lays her head on the pyre with the most philosophical
composure.</div>

<p class='c001'>Nothing short of the abrogation of the doctrines which pronounce
such sacrifices exculpatory can be effectual in preventing
them; but this would be to overturn the fundamental article of
their creed, the notion of metempsychosis. Further research
may disclose means more attainable, and the sacred Shastras are
at once the surest and the safest. Whoever has examined these
is aware of the conflict of authorities for and against cremation;
but a proper application of them (and they are the highest who
give it not their sanction) has, I believe, never been resorted to.
Vyasa, the chronicler of the Yadus, a race whose manners were
decidedly Scythic, is the great advocate for female sacrifice: he
(in the Mahabharata) pronounces the expiation perfect. But
Manu inculcates no such doctrine [635]; and although the state
of widowhood he recommends might be deemed onerous by the
fair sex of the west, it would be considered little hardship in the
east. “Let her emaciate her body, by living voluntarily on pure
flowers, roots, and fruit; but let her not, when her lord is deceased,
even pronounce the name of another man.” Again he says, “A
virtuous wife ascends to heaven, if, after the decease of her lord,
she devote herself to pious austerity; but a widow, who slights her
deceased husband by marrying again, brings disgrace on herself
here below, and shall be excluded from the seat of her lord.”<a id='r4.24.1' /><a href='#f4.24.1' class='c013'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>These and many other texts, enjoining purity of life and
manners to the widow, are to be found in this first authority, but
none demanding such a cruel pledge of affection. Abstinence
from the common pursuits of life, and entire self-denial, are
rewarded by “high renown in this world, and in the next the
abode of her husband”; and procure for her the title of “<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>sadhwi</em></span>,
or the virtuous.” These are deemed sufficient pledges of affection
by the first of sages.<a id='r4.24.2' /><a href='#f4.24.2' class='c013'><sup>[2]</sup></a> So much has been written on this subject
that we shall not pursue it further in this place; but proceed to
consider a still more inhuman practice, infanticide.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_739'>739</span>Although custom sanctions, and religion rewards, a Sati, the
victim to marital selfishness, yet, to the honour of humanity,
neither traditionary adage nor religious text can be quoted in
support of a practice so revolting as infanticide. Man alone, of
the whole animal creation, is equal to the task of destroying his
offspring [636]: for instinct preserves what reason destroys.
The wife is the sacrifice to his egotism, and the progeny of her
own sex to his pride; and if the unconscious infant should escape
the influence of the latter, she is only reserved to become the
victim of the former at the period when life is most desirous of
extension. If the female reasoned on her destiny, its hardships
are sufficient to stifle all sense of joy, and produce indifference to
life. When a female is born, no anxious inquiries await the
mother—no greetings welcome the newcomer, who appears an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_740'>740</span>intruder on the scene, which often closes in the hour of its birth.
But the very silence with which a female birth is accompanied
forcibly expresses sorrow; and we dare not say that many
compunctious visitings do not obtrude themselves on those
who, in accordance with custom and imagined necessity, are
thus compelled to violate the sentiments of nature. Families
may exult in the Satis which their cenotaphs portray,<a id='r4.24.3' /><a href='#f4.24.3' class='c013'><sup>[3]</sup></a> but
none ever heard a Rajput boast of the destruction of his infant
progeny.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Origin of Infanticide.</h4>—What are the causes, we may ask,
sufficiently powerful to induce the suppression of a feeling which
every sentient being has in common for its offspring? To
suppose the Rajput devoid of this sentiment would argue his
deficiency in the ordinary attributes of humanity: often is he
heard to exclaim, “Accursed the day when a woman child was
born to me!” The same motive which studded Europe with
convents, in which youth and beauty were immured until liberated
by death, first prompted the Rajput to infanticide: and, however
revolting the policy, it is perhaps kindness compared to
incarceration. There can be no doubt that monastic seclusion,
practised by the Frisians in France, the Langobardi in Italy, and
the Visigoths in Spain, was brought from Central Asia, the cradle
of the Goths.<a id='r4.24.4' /><a href='#f4.24.4' class='c013'><sup>[4]</sup></a> It is, in fact, a modification of the same feeling
which characterizes the Rajput and the ancient German warrior—the
dread of dishonour to the fair: the former raises the poniard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_741'>741</span>to the breast of his wife rather than witness her captivity, and he
gives the opiate to the infant, whom, if he cannot portion and
marry to her equal, he dare not see degraded [637].</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Infanticide.</h4>—Although religion nowhere authorizes this barbarity,
the laws which regulate marriage amongst the Rajputs
powerfully promote infanticide. Not only is intermarriage prohibited
between families of the same clan (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>khanp</em></span>), but between
those of the same tribe (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>got</em></span>); and though centuries may have
intervened since their separation, and branches thus transplanted
may have lost their original patronymic, they can never be regrafted
on the original stem: for instance, though eight centuries
have separated the two grand subdivisions of the Guhilots, and
the younger, the Sesodia, has superseded the elder, the Aharya,
each ruling distinct States, a marriage between any of the branches
would be deemed incestuous: the Sesodia is yet brother to the
Aharya, and regards every female of the race as his sister. Every
tribe has therefore to look abroad, to a race distinct from its own,
for suitors for the females. Foreign war, international feuds,
or other calamities affect tribes the most remote from each other;
nor can war or famine thin the clans of Marwar, without diminishing
the female population of Amber: thus both suffer in a twofold
degree. Many virtuous and humane princes have endeavoured
to check or mitigate an evil, in the eradication of which every
parental feeling would co-operate. Sumptuary edicts alone can
control it; and the Rajputs were never sufficiently enamoured
of despotism to permit it to rule within their private dwellings.
The plan proposed, and in some degree followed by the great
Jai Singh of Amber, might with caution be pursued, and with
great probability of success. He submitted to the prince of
every Rajput State a decree, which was laid before a convocation
of their respective vassals, in which he regulated the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>daeja</em></span> or
dower, and other marriage expenditure, with reference to the
property of the vassal, limiting it to one year’s income of the
estate. This plan was, however, frustrated by the vanity of
the Chondawat of Salumbar, who expended on the marriage of
his daughter a sum even greater than his sovereign could have
afforded; and to have his name blazoned by the bards and
genealogists, he sacrificed the beneficent views of one of the
wisest of the Rajput race. Until vanity suffers itself to be
controlled, and the aristocratic Rajput submit to republican
<span class='pageno' id='Page_742'>742</span>simplicity,<a id='r4.24.5' /><a href='#f4.24.5' class='c013'><sup>[5]</sup></a> the evils arising from nuptial profusion will not cease.
Unfortunately, those who could check it find their interest in
stimulating it, namely, the whole class of Mangtas [638] (mendicants),
bards, minstrels, jugglers, Brahmans who assemble on these
occasions, and pour forth their epithalamiums in praise of the
virtue of liberality. The Bardais are the grand recorders of fame,
and the volume of precedent is always recurred to, in citing the
liberality of former chiefs; while the dread of their satire (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>visarva</em></span>,
literally ‘poison’)<a id='r4.24.6' /><a href='#f4.24.6' class='c013'><sup>[6]</sup></a> shuts the eyes of the chiefs to consequences,
and they are only anxious to maintain the reputation of their
ancestors, though fraught with future ruin. “The Dahima
emptied his coffers” (says Chand, the pole-star of the Rajputs)
“on the marriage of his daughter with Prithiraj; but he filled
them with the praises of mankind.” The same bard retails every
article of these <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>daejas</em></span> or ‘dowers,’ which thus become precedents
for future ages; and the “<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>lakh pasarna</em></span>,”<a id='r4.24.7' /><a href='#f4.24.7' class='c013'><sup>[7]</sup></a> then established for
the chief bardai, has become a model to posterity. Even now
the Rana of Udaipur, in his season of poverty, at the recent
marriage of his daughters bestowed “the gift of a lakh” on the
chief bard; though the articles of gold, horses, clothes, etc., were
included in the estimate, and at an undue valuation, which
rendered the gift not quite so precious as in the days of the
Chauhan. Were bonds taken from all the feudal chiefs, and a
penal clause inserted, of forfeiture of their fief by all who exceeded
a fixed nuptial expenditure, the axe would be laid to the root,
the evil would be checked, and the heart of many a mother (and
we may add father) be gladdened, by preserving at once the point
of honour and their child. When ignorance declaims against
the gratuitous love of murder amongst these brave men, our
contempt is excited equally by its short-sighted conclusions, and
the affected philanthropy which overlooks all remedy but the
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>sic volo</em></span>.” Sir John Shore,<a id='r4.24.8' /><a href='#f4.24.8' class='c013'><sup>[8]</sup></a> when acting on the suggestions of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_743'>743</span>the benevolent Duncan for the suppression of this practice
amongst the Rajkumars, judged more wisely as a politician, and
more charitably in his estimate of human motives. “A prohibition,”
says he, “enforced by the denunciation of the severest
temporal penalties, would have had little efficacy in abolishing a
custom which existed in opposition to the feelings of humanity
and natural affection”; but “the sanction of that religion which
the Rajkumars professed was appealed to in aid of the ordinances
of civil authority; and an engagement binding themselves to
desist from the barbarous practice was prepared, and circulated
for signature amongst the Rajkumars.” It may well be doubted
how far this influence could extend, when the root of the evil [639]
remained untouched, though not unseen, as the philanthropic
Duncan pointed out in the confession of the Rajkumars: “all
unequivocally admitted it, but all did not fully acknowledge its
atrocity; and the only reason they assigned for the inhuman
practice was the great expense of procuring suitable matches for
their daughters, if they allowed them to grow up.” The Rajkumar
is one of the Chauhan sakha, chief of the Agnikulas, and in
proportion to its high and well-deserved pretensions on the score of
honour, it has more infanticides than any other of the “thirty-six
royal races.” Amongst those of this race out of the pale of
feudalism, and subjected to powers not Rajput, the practice is
fourfold greater, from the increased pressure of the cause which
gave it birth, and the difficulty of establishing their daughters
in wedlock. Raja Jai Singh’s enactment went far to remedy
this. Conjoin his plan with Mr. Duncan’s, provide dowers, and
infanticide will cease. It is only by removing the cause that the
consequences can be averted.<a id='r4.24.9' /><a href='#f4.24.9' class='c013'><sup>[9]</sup></a></div>

<p class='c001'>As to the almost universality of this practice amongst the
Jarejas, the leading cause, which will also operate to its continuance,
has been entirely overlooked. The Jarejas were
Rajputs, a subdivision of the Yadus; but by intermarriage with
the Muhammadans, to whose faith they became proselytes, they
lost their caste. Political causes have disunited them from the
Muhammadans, and they desire again to be considered as pure
Rajputs; but having been contaminated, no Rajput will intermarry
with them. The owner of a hyde of land, whether Sesodia,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_744'>744</span>Rathor, or Chauhan, would scorn the hand of a Jareja princess.
Can the “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>sic volo</em></span>” be applied to men who think in this fashion?</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Johar.</h4>—Having thus pointed out the causes of the sacrifice of
widows and of infants, I shall touch on the yet more awful rite
of Johar, when a whole tribe may become extinct, of which
several instances have been recorded in the annals of Mewar.
To the fair of other lands the fate of the Rajputni must appear
one of appalling hardship. In each stage of life death is ready
to claim her; by the poppy at its dawn, by the flames in riper
years; while the safety of the interval depending on the uncertainty
of war, at no period is her existence worth a twelve-month’s
purchase. The loss of a battle, or the capture of a city,
is a signal to avoid captivity and its horrors, which to the Rajputni
are worse than death. To the doctrines of Christianity
Europe owes the boon of protection to the helpless and the fair,
who are [640] comparatively safe amidst the vicissitudes of war;
to which security the chivalry of the Middle Ages doubtless contributed.
But it is singular that a nation so refined, so scrupulous
in its ideas with regard to females, as the Rajput, should not have
entered into some national compact to abandon such proof of
success as the bondage<a id='r4.24.10' /><a href='#f4.24.10' class='c013'><sup>[10]</sup></a> of the sex. We can enter into the feeling,
and applaud the deed, which ensured the preservation of their
honour by the fatal johar, when the foe was the brutalized Tatar.
But the practice was common in the international wars of the
Rajputs; and I possess numerous inscriptions (on stone and on
brass) which record as the first token of victory the captive wives
of the foeman. When “the mother of Sisera looked out of the
window, and cried through the lattice, Why tarry the wheels of
his chariot—have they not sped? have they not divided the prey;
to every man a damsel or two?”<a id='r4.24.11' /><a href='#f4.24.11' class='c013'><sup>[11]</sup></a> we have a perfect picture of
the Rajput mother expecting her son from the foray.</div>

<p class='c001'>The Jewish law with regard to female captives was perfectly
analogous to that of Manu; both declare them “lawful prize,”
and both Moses and Manu establish rules sanctioning the marriage
of such captives with the captors. “When a girl is made captive
by her lover, after a victory over her kinsman,” marriage “is

kinsman and friends have been slain in battle,”<a id='r4.24.13' /><a href='#f4.24.13' class='c013'><sup>[13]</sup></a> is the counterpart
of the ordinance regarding the usage of a captive in the
Pentateuch,<a id='r4.24.14' /><a href='#f4.24.14' class='c013'><sup>[14]</sup></a> excepting the “shaving of the head,” which is the
sign of complete slavery with the Hindu.<a id='r4.24.15' /><a href='#f4.24.15' class='c013'><sup>[15]</sup></a> When Hector, anticipating
his fall, predicts the fate which awaits Andromache, he
draws a forcible picture of the misery of the Rajput; but the
latter, instead of a lachrymose and enervating harangue as he
prepared for the battle with the same chance of defeat, would
have spared her the pain of plying the “Argive loom” by her
death. To prevent such degradation, the brave [641] Rajput
has recourse to the johar, or immolation of every female of the
family: nor can we doubt that, educated as are the females of
that country, they gladly embrace such a refuge from pollution.
Who would not be a Rajput in such a case? The very term
widow (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>rand</em></span>) is used in common parlance as one of reproach.<a id='r4.24.16' /><a href='#f4.24.16' class='c013'><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Manu commands that whoever accosts a woman shall do so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_746'>746</span>by the title of “sister,”<a id='r4.24.17' /><a href='#f4.24.17' class='c013'><sup>[17]</sup></a> and that “way must be made for her,
even as for the aged, for a priest, a prince, or a bridegroom”;
and in the admirable text on the laws of hospitality, he ordains
that “pregnant women, brides, and damsels shall have food
before all the other guests”<a id='r4.24.18' /><a href='#f4.24.18' class='c013'><sup>[18]</sup></a>; which, with various other texts,
appears to indicate a time when women were less than now
objects of restraint; a custom attributable to the paramount
dominion of the Muhammadans, from whose rigid system the
Hindus have borrowed. But so many conflicting texts are to be
found in the pages of Manu, that we may pronounce the compilation
never to have been the work of the same legislator:
from whose dicta we may select with equal facility texts tending
to degrade as to exalt the sex. For the following he would meet
with many plaudits: “Let women be constantly supplied with
ornaments at festivals and jubilees, for if the wife be not elegantly
attired, she will not exhilarate her husband. A wife gaily
adorned, the whole house is embellished.”<a id='r4.24.19' /><a href='#f4.24.19' class='c013'><sup>[19]</sup></a> In the following
text he pays an unequivocal compliment to her power: “A
female is able to draw from the right path in this life, not a fool
only, but even a sage, and can lead him in subjection to desire
or to wrath.” With this acknowledgment from the very fountain
of authority, we have some ground for asserting that <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>les
femmes font les m&oelig;urs</em></span>, even in Rajputana; and that though
immured and invisible, their influence on society is not less
certain than if they moved in the glare of open day.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Position of Rājput Women.</h4>—Most erroneous ideas have been
formed of the Hindu female from the pictures drawn by those
who never left the banks of the Ganges. They are represented
[642] as degraded beings, and that not one in many thousands
can even read. I would ask such travellers whether they know
the name of Rajput, for there are few of the lowest chieftains
whose daughters are not instructed both to read and write;
though the customs of the country requiring much form in
epistolary writing, only the signature is made to letters. But
of their intellect, and knowledge of mankind, whoever has had
to converse with a Rajputni guardian of her son’s rights, must
draw a very different conclusion.<a id='r4.24.20' /><a href='#f4.24.20' class='c013'><sup>[20]</sup></a> Though excluded by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_747'>747</span>Salic law of India from governing, they are declared to be fit
regents during minority; and the history of India is filled with
anecdotes of able and valiant females in this capacity.<a id='r4.24.21' /><a href='#f4.24.21' class='c013'><sup>[21]</sup></a></div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Rājput Character.</h4>—The more prominent traits of character
will be found disseminated throughout the annals; we shall
therefore omit the customary summaries of nationalities, those
fanciful debtor and creditor accounts, with their balanced amount,
favourable or unfavourable according to the disposition of the
observer; and from the anecdotes through these pages leave
the reader to form his own judgement of the Rajput. High
courage, patriotism, loyalty, honour, hospitality, and simplicity
are qualities which must at once be conceded to them; and if
we cannot vindicate them from charges to which human nature
in every clime is obnoxious; if we are compelled to admit the
deterioration of moral dignity, from the continual inroads of,
and their consequent collision with, rapacious conquerors; we
must yet admire the quantum of virtue which even oppression
and bad example have failed to banish. The meaner vices of
deceit and falsehood, which the delineators of national character
attach to the Asiatic without distinction, I deny to be universal
with the Rajputs, though some tribes may have been obliged
from position to use these shields of the weak against continuous
oppression. Every court in Rajasthan has [643] its characteristic
epithet; and there is none held more contemptible than the affix
<span class='pageno' id='Page_748'>748</span>of <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>jhutha darbar</em></span>, ‘the lying court,’ applied to Jaipur; while the
most comprehensive measure of praise is the simple epithet of
<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>sachha</em></span>,<a id='r4.24.22' /><a href='#f4.24.22' class='c013'><sup>[22]</sup></a> ‘the truth-teller.’ Again, there are many shades
between deceit and dissimulation: the one springs from natural
depravity; the other may be assumed, as with the Rajput, in
self-defence. But their laws, the mode of administering them,
and the operation of external causes, must be attentively considered
before we can form a just conclusion of the springs which
regulate the character of a people. We must examine the
opinions of the competent of past days, when political independence
yet remained to the Rajputs, and not found our judgment
of a nation upon a superficial knowledge of individuals.
To this end I shall avail myself of the succinct but philosophical
remarks of Abu-l-fazl, the wise minister of the wise Akbar, which
are equally applicable to mankind at large, as to the particular
people we are treating of. “If,” he says, speaking of the Hindus,
“a diligent investigator were to examine the temper and disposition
of the people of each tribe, he would find every individual
differing in some respect or other. Some among them are
virtuous in the highest degree, and others carry vice to the
greatest excess. They are renowned for wisdom, disinterested
friendship, obedience to their superiors, and many other virtues:
but, at the same time, there are among them men whose hearts
are obdurate and void of shame, turbulent spirits, who for the
merest trifle will commit the greatest outrages.”<a id='r4.24.23' /><a href='#f4.24.23' class='c013'><sup>[23]</sup></a></div>

<p class='c001'>Again: “The Hindus are religious, affable, courteous to
strangers, cheerful, enamoured of knowledge, lovers of justice,
able in business, grateful, admirers of truth, and of unbounded
fidelity in all their dealings. Their character shines brightest in
adversity. Their soldiers (the Rajputs) know not what it is to
fly from the field of battle; but when the success of the combat
becomes doubtful, they dismount from their horses, and throw
away their lives in payment of the debt of valour.”<a id='r4.24.24' /><a href='#f4.24.24' class='c013'><sup>[24]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>I shall conclude this chapter with a sketch of their familiar
habits, and a few of their indoor and outdoor recreations.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Introduction of Melons, Grapes, Tobacco, Opium: the Use of
Opium.</h4>—To Babur, the founder of the Mogul dynasty, India is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_749'>749</span>indebted for the introduction [644] of its melons and grapes;
and to his grandson Jahangir for tobacco.<a id='r4.24.25' /><a href='#f4.24.25' class='c013'><sup>[25]</sup></a> For the introduction
of opium we have no date, and it is not even mentioned in the
poems of Chand.<a id='r4.24.26' /><a href='#f4.24.26' class='c013'><sup>[26]</sup></a> This pernicious plant has robbed the Rajput
of half his virtues; and while it obscures these, it heightens his
vices, giving to his natural bravery a character of insane ferocity,
and to the countenance, which would otherwise beam with
intelligence, an air of imbecility. Like all stimulants, its effects
are magical for a time; but the reaction is not less certain: and
the faded form or amorphous bulk too often attest the debilitating
influence of a drug which alike debases mind and body. In the
more ancient epics we find no mention of the poppy-juice as now
used, though the Rajput has at all times been accustomed to his
<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>madhava ra piyala</em></span>, or ‘intoxicating cup.’ The essence,<a id='r4.24.27' /><a href='#f4.24.27' class='c013'><sup>[27]</sup></a> whether
of grain, of roots, or of flowers, still welcomes the guest, but is
secondary to the opiate. <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>Amal lar khana</em></span>, ‘to eat opium together,’
is the most inviolable pledge; and an agreement ratified by this
ceremony is stronger than any adjuration. If a Rajput pays a
visit, the first question is, <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>amal khaya</em></span>? ‘have you had your
opiate?’—<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>amal khao</em></span>, ‘take your opiate.’ On a birthday, when
all the chiefs convene to congratulate their brother on another
‘knot to his years,’ the large cup is brought forth, a lump of
opiate put therein, upon which water is poured, and by the aid
of a stick a solution is made, to which each helps his neighbour,
not with a glass, but with the hollow of his hand held to his mouth.
To judge by the wry faces on this occasion, none can like it, and
to get rid of the nauseous taste, comfit-balls are handed round.
It is curious to observe the animation it inspires; a Rajput is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_750'>750</span>fit for nothing without his <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>amal</em></span>, and I have often dismissed their
men of business to refresh their intellects by a dose, for when its
effects are dissipating they become mere logs [645].<a id='r4.24.28' /><a href='#f4.24.28' class='c013'><sup>[28]</sup></a> Opium to
the Rajput is more necessary than food, and a suggestion to the
Rana to tax it highly was most unpopular. From the rising
generation the author exacted promises that they would resist
initiation in this vice, and many grew up in happy ignorance of
the taste of opium. He will be the greatest friend to Rajasthan
who perseveres in eradicating the evil. The valley of Udaipur
is a poppy garden, of every hue and variety, whence the Hindu
Sri may obtain a coronet more variegated than ever adorned
the Isis of the Nile.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Pledge by eating Opium.</h4>—A pledge once given by the Rajput,
whether ratified by the “eating opium together,” “an exchange
of turbans,” or the more simple act of “giving the right hand,”
is maintained inviolable under all circumstances.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Hunting and other Sports.</h4>—Their grand hunts have been
described. The Rajput is fond of his dog and his gun. The
former aids him in pulling down the boar or hare, and with the
stalking-horse he will toil for hours after the deer. The greater
<span class='pageno' id='Page_751'>751</span>chieftains have their <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>ramnas</em></span> or preserves, where poaching would
be summarily punished, and where the slaughter of all kinds of
beasts, elk, hog, hyena, tiger, boar, deer, wild-dog, wolf, or hare,
is indiscriminate. Riding in the ring with the lance in tournaments,
without the spike, the point being guarded; defence of
the sword against the lance, with every variety of “noble horsemanship,”
such as would render the most expert in Europe an
easy prey to the active Rajput, are some of the chief exercises.
Firing at a mark with a matchlock, in which they attain remarkable
accuracy of aim; and in some parts of the country throwing
a dart or javelin from horseback, are favourite amusements. The
practice of the bow is likewise a main source of pastime, and in
the manner there adopted it requires both dexterity and strength<a id='r4.24.29' /><a href='#f4.24.29' class='c013'><sup>[29]</sup></a>
[646]. The Rajput is not satisfied if he cannot bury his arrow either
in the earthern target, or in the buffalo, to the feather. The use
of the bow is hallowed; Arjuna’s bow in the “great war,” and
that of the Chauhan king, Prithiraj, with which the former gained
Draupadi and the latter the fair Sanjogta, are immortalized like
that of Ulysses. In these martial exercises the youthful Rajput
is early initiated, and that the sight of blood may be familiar,
he is instructed, before he has strength to wield a sword, to
practise with his boy’s scimitar on the heads of lambs and kids.
His first successful essay on the animals ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>ferae naturae</em></span>’ is a source
of congratulation to his whole family.<a id='r4.24.30' /><a href='#f4.24.30' class='c013'><sup>[30]</sup></a> In this manner the spirit
of chivalry is continually fed, for everything around him speaks
of arms and strife. His very amusements are warlike; and the
dance and the song, the burthen of which is the record of his
successful gallantry, so far from enervating, serve as fresh incitements
to his courage.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Wrestling.</h4>—The exhibition of the Jethis, or wrestlers,<a id='r4.24.31' /><a href='#f4.24.31' class='c013'><sup>[31]</sup></a> is
another mode of killing time. It is a state concern for every
prince or chief to entertain a certain number of these champions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_752'>752</span>of the glove. Challenges are sent by the most celebrated from
one court to another; and the event of the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>akhara</em></span>, as the arena
is termed, is looked to with great anxiety.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Armouries.</h4>—No prince or chief is without his <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>silah-khana</em></span>, or
armoury, where he passes hours in viewing and arranging his
arms. Every favourite weapon, whether sword, matchlock,
spear, dagger, or bow, has a distinctive epithet. The keeper of
the armoury is one of the most confidential officers about the
person of the prince. These arms are beautiful and costly. The
<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>sirohi</em></span>,<a id='r4.24.32' /><a href='#f4.24.32' class='c013'><sup>[32]</sup></a> or slightly curved blade, is formed like that of Damascus,
and is the greatest favourite of all the variety of sabres throughout
Rajputana. The long cut-and-thrust, like the Andrea
Ferrara, is not uncommon; nor the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>khanda</em></span>, or double-edged
sword. The matchlocks both of Lahore and the country are
often highly finished and inlaid with mother-of-pearl and gold:
those of Bundi are the best. The shield of the rhinoceros-hide
offers the best resistance, and is often ornamented with animals,
beautifully painted, and enamelled in gold and silver. The bow
is of buffalo-horn, and the arrows of reed, and barbed in a variety
of fashions, as the crescent, the trident, the snake’s tongue, and
other fanciful forms.</div>

<p class='c001'><b>Sheodān Singh. Music.</b>—The Maharaja Sheodan Singh
(whose family are heirs presumptive to the throne) was one of
my constant visitors; and the title of ‘adopted brother,’ which
he conferred upon me, allowed him to make his visits unreasonably
long. The Maharaja had many excellent qualities. He
was the best shot in Mewar; he was well read in the classic
literature of his nation; deeply versed in the secrets of the
chronicles, not only of Mewar but of all Rajwara; conversant
with all the mysteries of the bard, and could improvise on every
occasion. He was a proficient in musical science [647], and could
discourse most fluently on the whole theory of Sangita, which
comprehends vocal and instrumental harmony. He could explain
each of the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>ragas</em></span>, or musical modes, which issued from the five
mouths of Siva and his consort Mena, together with the almost
endless variations of the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>ragas</em></span>, to each of which are allotted six
<span class='pageno' id='Page_753'>753</span>consorts or <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>raginis</em></span>. He had attached to his suite the first vocalists
of Mewar, and occasionally favoured me by letting them sing at
my house. The chief cantatrice had a superb voice, a contralto
of great extent, and bore the familiar appellation of ‘Catalani.’
Her execution of all the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>basant</em></span> or ‘spring-songs,’ and the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>megh</em></span>
or ‘cloud-songs’ of the monsoon, which are full of melody, was
perfect. But she had a rival in a singer from Ujjain, and we
made a point of having them together, that emulation might
excite to excellence. The chieftain of Salumbar, the chief of
the Saktawats, and others, frequently joined these parties, as
well as the Maharaja: for all are partial to the dance and the
song, during which conversation flows unrestrained. Saadatu-lla,
whose execution on the guitar would have secured applause even
at the Philharmonic, commanded mute attention when he played
a <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>tan</em></span> or symphony, or when, taking any of the simple <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>tappas</em></span> of
Ujjain as a theme, he wandered through a succession of voluntaries.
In summer these little parties were held on the terrace or the
house-top, where carpets were spread under an awning, while
the cool breezes of the lake gave life after the exhaustion of a
day passed under 96° of Fahrenheit. The subjects of their songs
are various, love, glory, satire, etc. I was invited to similar
assemblies by many of the chiefs; though none were so intellectual
as those of the Maharaja. On birthdays or other festivals the
chief Bardai often appears, or the bard of any other tribe who may
happen to be present. Then all is mute attention, broken only by
the emphatic “<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>wah, wah!</em></span>” the measured nod of the head, or fierce
curl of the moustache, in token of approbation or the reverse.<a id='r4.24.33' /><a href='#f4.24.33' class='c013'><sup>[33]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The Maharaja’s talents for amplification were undoubted,
and by more than one of his friends this failing was attributed to
his long residence at the court of Jaipur, whose cognomen will
not have been forgotten. He had one day been amusing us with
feats of his youth, his swimming from island to island, and [648]
bestriding the alligators for an excursion.<a id='r4.24.34' /><a href='#f4.24.34' class='c013'><sup>[34]</sup></a> Like Tell, he had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_754'>754</span>placed a mark on his son’s head and hit it successfully. He
could kill an eagle on the wing, and divide a ball on the edge
of a knife, the knife itself unseen. While running on in this
manner, my features betraying some incredulity, he insisted on
redeeming his word. A day was accordingly appointed, and
though labouring under an ague, he came with his favourite
matchlocks. The more dangerous experiment was desisted from,
and he commenced by dividing the ball on the knife. This he
placed perpendicularly in the centre of an earthen vessel filled
with water; and taking his station at about twenty paces, perforated
the centre of the vessel, and allowed you to take up the
fragments of the ball; having previously permitted you to load
the piece, and examine the vessel, which he did not once approach
himself. Another exhibition was striking an orange from a pole
without perforating it. Again, he gave the option of loading to
a bystander, and retreating a dozen paces, he knocked an orange
off untouched by the ball, which, according to a preliminary
proviso, could not be found: the orange was not even discoloured
by the powder. He was an adept also at chess<a id='r4.24.35' /><a href='#f4.24.35' class='c013'><sup>[35]</sup></a> and chaupar,
and could carry on a conversation by stringing flowers in a peculiar
manner. If he plumed himself upon his pretensions, his vanity
was always veiled under a demeanour full of courtesy and grace;
and Maharaja Sheodan Singh would be esteemed a well-bred and
well-informed man at the most polished court of Europe.</p>

<p class='c001'>Every chief has his band, vocal and instrumental; but Sindhia,
some years since, carried away the most celebrated vocalists of
Udaipur. The Rajputs are all partial to music. The tappa is
the favourite measure. Its chief character is plaintive simplicity;
and it is analogous to the Scotch, or perhaps still more to the
Norman.<a id='r4.24.36' /><a href='#f4.24.36' class='c013'><sup>[36]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_755'>755</span>The Rana, who is a great patron of the art, has a small band
of musicians, whose only instrument is the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>shahna</em></span>, or hautboy.
They played their national [649] tappas with great taste and
feeling; and these strains, wafted from the lofty terrace of the
palace in the silence of the night, produced a sensation of delight
not unmixed with pain, which its peculiarly melancholy character
excites. The Rana has also a few flute or flageolet players, who
discourse most eloquent music. Indeed, we may enumerate this
among the principal amusements of the Rajputs; and although
it would be deemed indecorous to be a performer, the science
forms a part of education.<a id='r4.24.37' /><a href='#f4.24.37' class='c013'><sup>[37]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Who that has marched in the stillness of night through the
mountainous regions of Central India, and heard the warder
sound the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>turai</em></span> from his turreted abode, perched like an eyrie

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Bagpipes.</h4>—A species of bagpipe, so common to all the Celtic
races of Europe, is not unknown to the Rajputs. It is called the
<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>mashak</em></span>,<a id='r4.24.39' /><a href='#f4.24.39' class='c013'><sup>[39]</sup></a> but is only the rudiment of that instrument whose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_756'>756</span>peculiar influence on the physical, through the moral agency of
man, is described by our own master-bard. They have likewise
the double flageolet; but in the same ratio of perfection to that
of Europe as the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>mashak</em></span> to the heart-stirring pipe of the north.
As to their lutes, guitars, and all the varieties of tintinnabulants
(as Dr. Johnson would call them), it would fatigue without interesting
the reader to enumerate them.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Literature among the Rajputs. Observatories.</h4>—We now come
to the literary attainments of the lords of Rajasthan, of whom
there is none without sufficient clerkship to read his grant or
agreement for <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>rakhwali</em></span> or blackmail; and none either so ignorant,
or so proud, as the boasted ancestral wisdom of England, whose
barons could not even sign their names to the great charter of
their liberties. The Rana of Udaipur has unlimited command
of [650] his pen, and his letters are admirable; but we may
say of him nearly what was remarked of Charles the Second—“he
never wrote a foolish thing, and seldom did a wise one.”
The familiar epistolary correspondence of the princes and nobles
of Rajasthan would exhibit abundant testimony of their powers
of mind: they are sprinkled with classical allusions, and evince
that knowledge of mankind which constant collision in society
must produce. A collection of these letters, which exist in the
archives of every principality, would prove that the princes of
this country are upon a par with the rest of mankind, not only
in natural understanding, but, taking their opportunities into
account, even in its cultivation. The prince who in Europe
could quote Hesiod and Homer with the freedom that the Rana
does on all occasions Vyasa and Valmiki, would be accounted a
prodigy; and there is not a divine who could make application
of the ordinances of Moses with more facility than the Rana of
those of their great lawgiver Manu. When they talk of the
wisdom of their ancestors, it is not a mere figure of speech. The
instruction of their princes is laid down in rules held sacred, and
must have been far more onerous than any system of European
university education, for scarcely a branch of human knowledge
is omitted. But the cultivation of the mind, and the arts of
polished life, must always flourish in the ratio of a nation’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_757'>757</span>prosperity, and from the decline of the one, we may date the
deterioration of the other with the Rajput. The astronomer
has now no patron to look to for reward; there is no Jai Singh
to erect such stupendous observatories as he built at Delhi,
Benares, Ujjain, and at his own capital;<a id='r4.24.40' /><a href='#f4.24.40' class='c013'><sup>[40]</sup></a> to construct globes
and armillary spheres, of which, according to their own and our
system, the Kotah prince has two, each three feet in diameter.
The same prince (Jai Singh) collated De la Hire’s tables with
those of Ulugh Beg, and presented the result to the last emperor
of Delhi, worthy the name of the Great Mogul. To these tables

<p class='c001'>But we cannot march over fifty miles of country without

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Household Furniture.</h4>—In their household economy, their
furniture and decorations, they remain unchanged during the
lapse of a thousand years. No chairs, no couches adorn their
sitting apartments, though the painted and gilded ceiling may
be supported by columns of serpentine, and the walls one mass
of mirrors, marble, or china;—nothing but a soft carpet, hidden
by a white cloth, on which the guests seat themselves according
to rank. In fine, the quaint description of the chaplain to the
first embassy which England sent to India, more than two hundred
years ago, applies now, as it probably will two hundred years
hence. “And now for the furniture the greatest men have in
them [their houses], it is <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>curta supellex</em></span>, very little, they (the
rooms) being not beautified with hangings, nor with anything
besides to line their walls; for they have no chairs, stools, couches,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_758'>758</span>tables, beds enclosed with canopies, or curtains, in any of their
rooms. And the truth is, that if they had them, the extreme
heat would forbid the use of many of them; all their bravery
is upon their floors, on which they spread most excellent carpets.”<a id='r4.24.41' /><a href='#f4.24.41' class='c013'><sup>[41]</sup></a></div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Dress.</h4>—It were useless to expatiate on dress, either male or
female, the fashion varying in each province and tribe, though
the texture and materials are everywhere the same: cotton in
summer, and quilted chintz or broadcloth in winter. The ladies
have only three articles of <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>parure</em></span>; the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>ghaghra</em></span>, or ‘petticoat’;
the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>kanchuli</em></span>, ‘or corset’; and the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>dopatta</em></span>, or ‘scarf,’ which is
occasionally thrown over [652] the head as a veil. Ornaments
are without number. For the men, trousers of every shape and
calibre, a tunic girded with a ceinture, and a scarf, form the wardrobe
of every Rajput. The turban is the most important part
of the dress, and is the unerring mark of the tribe; the form and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_759'>759</span>fashion are various, and its decorations differ according to time
and circumstances. The <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>balaband</em></span>, or ‘silken fillet,’ was once
valued as the mark of the sovereign’s favour, and was tantamount
to the courtly “orders” of Europe. The colour of the turban
and tunic varies with the season; and the changes are rung upon
crimson, saffron, and purple, though white is by far the most
common. Their shoes are mere slippers, and sandals are worn
by the common classes. Boots are yet used in hunting or war,
made of chamois leather, of which material the warrior often
has a doublet, being more commodious, and less oppressive,
than armour. The dagger or poniard is inseparable from the
girdle.</div>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r4.24.2'>2</a>. Were all Manu’s maxims on this head collected, and with other good
authorities, printed, circulated, and supported by Hindu missionaries, who
might be brought to advocate the abolition of Satiism, some good might be
effected. Let every text tending to the respectability of widowhood be
made prominent, and degrade the opponents by enumerating the weak
points they abound in. Instance the polyandry which prevailed among
the Pandus, whose high priest Vyasa was an illegitimate branch; though
above all would be the efficacy of the abolition of polygamy, which in the
lower classes leaves women destitute, and in the higher condemns them to
mortification and neglect. Whatever result such a course might produce,
there can be no danger in the experiment. Such sacrifices must operate
powerfully on manners; and, barbarous as is the custom, yet while it
springs from the same principle, it ought to improve the condition of women,
from the fear that harsh treatment of them might defeat the atonement
hereafter. Let the advocate for the abolition of this practice by the hand
of power read attentively Mr. Colebrooke’s essay, “On the Duties of a
Faithful Hindu Widow,” in the fourth volume of the <cite>Asiatic Researches</cite>
[<cite>Essays on the Religion and Philosophy of the Hindus</cite>, ed. 1858, p. 70 ff.],
to correct the notion that there is no adequate religious ordinance for the
horrid sacrifice. Mr. C. observes (p. 220): “Though an alternative be
allowed, the Hindu legislators have shown themselves disposed to encourage
widows to burn themselves with their husband’s corpse.” In this paper
he will find too many authorities deemed sacred for its support; but it is
only by knowing the full extent of the prejudices and carefully collecting
the conflicting authorities, that we can provide the means to overcome it.
Jahangir legislated for the abolition of this practice by successive ordinances.
At first he commanded that no woman, being mother of a family, should
under any circumstances be permitted, however willing, to immolate herself;
and subsequently the prohibition was made entire when the slightest
compulsion was required, “whatever the assurances of the people might
be.” The royal commentator records no reaction. We might imitate
Jahangir, and adopting the partially prohibitive ordinance, forbid the
sacrifice where there was a family to rear. [The early texts on the subject
of Sati have been collected by H. H. Wilson, <cite>Essays and Lectures chiefly on
the Religion of the Hindus</cite>, 1881, ii. 270 ff. Also see Max Müller, <cite>Selected

an early period of history were given to infanticide. “It was a custom
among them,” says Ferishta, “as soon as a female child was born, to carry
her to the market-place and there proclaim aloud, holding the child in one
hand and a knife in the other, that any person who wanted a wife might
now take her; otherwise she was immediately put to death. By this
means they had more men than women, which occasioned the custom of
several husbands to one wife. When this wife was visited by one of her
husbands, she set up a mark at the door, which being observed by any of
the others who might be coming on the same errand, he immediately withdrew
till the signal was taken away.”</p>

him with the epithet of “son,” and a gentle reproof. Kalyan was

<p class='c001'><a href='#r4.24.41'>41</a>. [E. Terry, <cite>A Voyage to East India</cite>, ed. 1777, p. 185.] Those who wish
for an opinion “of the most excellent moralities which are to be observed
amongst the people of these nations” cannot do better than read the 14th
section of the observant, intelligent, and tolerant chaplain, who is more
just, at least on one point, than the modern missionary, who denies to the
Hindu filial affection. “And here I shall insert another most needful
particular to my present purpose which deserves a most high commendation
to be given unto that people in general, how poor and mean soever they
be; and that is, the great exemplary care they manifest in their piety to
their parents, that notwithstanding they serve for very little, but five
shillings a moon for their whole livelihood and subsistence, yet if their
parents be in want, they will impart, at the least, half of that little towards
their necessities, choosing rather to want themselves than that their parents
should suffer need.” It is in fact one of the first precepts of their religion.
The Chaplain thus concludes his chapter “On the Moralities of the Hindu”
[232 f.]: “O! what a sad thing is it for Christians to come short of Indians,
even in moralities; come short of those, who themselves believe to come
short of heaven!” The Chaplain closes his interesting and instructive
work with the subject of Conversion, which is as remote from accomplishment
at this day as it was at that distant period. “Well known it is that
the Jesuits there, who, like the Pharisees that would ‘compass sea and land
to make one proselyte’ (Matt. xxiii. 15), have sent into Christendom many
large reports of their great conversions of infidels in East India. But all
these boastings are but reports; the truth is, that they have there spilt the
precious water of Baptism upon some few faces, working upon the necessity
of some poor men, who for want of means, which they give them, are contented
to wear crucifixes; but for want of knowledge in the doctrine of
Christianity are only in name Christians.”<a id='r4.24.41.A' /><a href='#f4.24.41.A' class='c013'><sup>[A]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c030'>CHAPTER 25</h3>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Leaving Udaipur.</h4>—<em>October 11, 1819.</em>—Two years had nearly
sped since we entered the valley of Udaipur, the most diversified
and most romantic spot on the continent of India. In all this
time none of us had penetrated beyond the rocky barrier which
formed the limit of our horizon, affording the vision a sweep of
six miles radius. Each hill and dale, tower and tree, had become
familiar to us; every altar, cenotaph, and shrine had furnished
its legend, till tradition was exhausted. The ruins were explored,
their inscriptions deciphered, each fantastic pinnacle had a
name, and the most remarkable chieftains and servants of the
court had epithets assigned to them, expressive of some quality
or characteristic. We had our ‘Red Reaver,’ our ‘Roderic Dhu,’
and a ‘Falstaff,’ at the court; our ‘Catalani,’ our ‘Vestris,’ in
the song or the ballet. We had our palace in the city, our cutter
on the lake, our villa in the woods, our fairy-islands in the waters;
streams to angle in, deer to [654] shoot, much, in short, to please
the eye and gratify the taste:—yet did ennui intrude, and all
panted to escape from the “happy valley,” to see what was in
the world beyond the mountains. In all these twenty moons,
the gigantic portals of Debari, which guard the entrance of the
Girwa,<a id='r4.25.1' /><a href='#f4.25.1' class='c013'><sup>[1]</sup></a> had not once creaked on their hinges for our egress;
and though from incessant occupation I had wherewithal to
lessen the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>taedium vitae</em></span>, my companions not having such resources,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_761'>761</span>it was in vain that, like the sage Imlac, I urged them not to feel
dull in this “blissful captivity”: the scenery had become
hideous, and I verily believe had there been any pinion-maker
in the capital of the Sesodias, they would have essayed a flight,
though it might have terminated in the lake. Never did Rasselas
sigh more for escape. At length the day arrived, and although
the change was to be from all that constitutes the enchantments
of vision, from wood and water, dale and mountain, verdure and
foliage, to the sterile plains of the sandy desert of Marwar, it was
sufficient that it was change. Our party was composed of Captain
Waugh, Lieutenant Carey, and Dr. Duncan, with the whole of
the escort, consisting of two companies of foot and sixty of
Skinner’s Horse, all alike delighted to quit the valley where each
had suffered more or less from the prevalent fevers of the monsoon,
during which the valley is peculiarly unhealthy, especially
to foreigners, when the wells and reservoirs overflow from the
springs which break in, impregnated with putrid vegetation and
mineral poisons, covering the surface with a bluish oily fluid.
The art of filtrating water to free it from impurities is unknown
to the Rajputs, and with some shame I record that we did not
make them wiser, though they are not strangers to the more
simple process, adopted throughout the desert, of using potash
and alum; the former to neutralize the salt and render the
water more fit for culinary purposes; the latter to throw down
the impurities held suspended. They also use an alkaline nut
in washing, which by simply steeping emits a froth which is a
good substitute for soap.<a id='r4.25.2' /><a href='#f4.25.2' class='c013'><sup>[2]</sup></a></div>

<p class='c001'>On the 12th October, at five <span class='fss'>A.M.</span>, our trumpet sounded to horse,
and we were not slow in obeying the summons; the “yellow
boys” with their old native commandant looking even more
cheerful than usual as we joined them. Skinner’s Horse<a id='r4.25.3' /><a href='#f4.25.3' class='c013'><sup>[3]</sup></a> wear
a jamah or tunic of yellow broadcloth, with scarlet turbans and
cincture. Who [655] does not know that James Skinner’s men
are the most orderly in the Company’s service, and that in every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_762'>762</span>other qualification constituting the efficient soldier, they are
second to none? On another signal which reverberated from
the palace, where the drums announced that the descendant of
Surya was no sluggard, we moved on through the yet silent
capital towards the gate of the sun, where we found drawn
up the quotas of Bhindar, Delwara, Amet, and Bansi, sent as
an honorary guard by the Rana, to escort us to the frontiers.
As they would have been an incumbrance to me and an inconvenience
to the country, from their laxity of discipline, after
chatting with their leader, during a sociable ride, I dismissed
them at the pass, with my respects to the Rana and their several
chieftains. We reached the camp before eight o’clock, the
distance being only thirteen miles. The spot chosen (and where
I afterwards built a residence) was a rising ground between the
villages of Merta and Tus, sprinkled with trees, and for a space
of four miles clear of the belt of forest which fringes the granite
barriers of the valley. It commanded an entire view of the
plains in the direction of Chitor, still covered, excepting a patch
of cultivation here and there, with jungle. The tiger-mount, its
preserves of game, and the mouldering hunting-seats of the
Rana and his chieftains, were three miles to the north; to the
south, a mile distant, we had the Berach River, abounding in
trout; and the noble lake whence it issues, called after its founder
the Udai Sagar, was not more than three to the west. For several
reasons it was deemed advisable to choose a spot out of the valley;
the health of the party, though not an unimportant, was not a
principal motive for choosing such a distance from the court.
The wretchedness in which we found it rendered a certain degree
of interference requisite, and it was necessary that they should
shake this off, in order to preserve their independence. It was
dreaded lest the aid requested by the Rana, from the peculiar
circumstances on our first going amongst them, might be construed
as a precedent for the intrusion of advice on after occasions.
The distance between the court and the agent of the British
Government was calculated to diminish this impression, and
obliged them also to trust to their own resources, after the
machine was once set in motion. On the heights of Tus our
tents were pitched, the escort paraded, and St. George’s flag
displayed. Here camels, almost wild, were fitted for the first
time with the pack-saddle, lamenting in discordant gutturals
<span class='pageno' id='Page_763'>763</span>the [656] hardship of their fate, though luckily ignorant of the
difference between grazing whither they listed in the happy valley,
and carrying a load in “the region of death,” where they would
only find the thorny mimosa or prickly <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>phog</em></span><a id='r4.25.4' /><a href='#f4.25.4' class='c013'><sup>[4]</sup></a> to satisfy their
hunger.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Pallāna.</h4>—<em>October 13.</em>—There being no greater trial of patience
than the preparations for a march after a long halt, we left the
camp at daybreak amidst the most discordant yells from the
throats of a hundred camels, which drowned every attempt to
be heard, while the elephants squeaked their delight in that
peculiar treble which they emit when happy. There was one
little fellow enjoying himself free from all restraints of curbs or
pack-saddles, and inserting his proboscis into the sepoy’s baggage,
whence he would extract a bag of flour, and move off, pursued by
the owner; which was sure to produce shouts of mirth to add
to the discord. This little representative of Ganesa was only
eight years old, and not more than twelve hands high. He was
a most agreeable pet, though the proofs he gave of his wisdom
in trusting himself amidst the men when cooking their dinners,
were sometimes disagreeable to them, but infinitely amusing to
those who watched his actions. The rains having broken up
unusually late, we found the boggy ground, on which we had to
march, totally unable to bear the pressure of loaded cattle; even
the ridges, which just showed their crests of quartz above the
surface, were not safe. Our route was over a fine plain well
wooded and watered, soil excellent, and studded with numerous
large villages; yet all presenting uniformly the effects of warfare
and rapine. The landscape, rendered the more interesting by
our long incarceration in the valley, was abstractedly pleasing.
On our left lay the mountains enclosing the capital, on one of
whose elevated peaks are the ruins of Ratakot, overlooking all
around; while to the east the eye might in vain seek for a boundary.
We passed Deopur, once a township of some consequence, and
forming part of the domain of the Bhanej,<a id='r4.25.5' /><a href='#f4.25.5' class='c013'><sup>[5]</sup></a> Zalim Singh, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_764'>764</span>heir of Marwar, whose history, if it could be given here, would
redeem the nobles of Rajputana from the charge of being of uncultivated
intellect. In listening to [657] his biography, both
time and place were unheeded; the narrator, my own venerable
Guru,<a id='r4.25.6' /><a href='#f4.25.6' class='c013'><sup>[6]</sup></a> had imbibed much of his varied knowledge from this
accomplished chieftain, to whom arms and letters were alike
familiar. He was the son of Raja Bijai Singh and a princess of
Mewar: but domestic quarrels made it necessary to abandon the
paternal for the maternal mansion, and a domain was assigned
by the Rana, which put him on a footing with his own children.
Without neglecting any of the martial amusements and exercises
of the Rajput, he gave up all those hours, generally devoted to
idleness, to the cultivation of letters. He was versed in philosophical
theology, astronomy, and the history of his country;
and in every branch of poesy, from the sacred canticles of Jayadeva
to the couplets of the modern bard, he was an adept. He
composed and improvised with facility, and his residence was
the rendezvous for every bard of fame. That my respected tutor
did not overrate his acquirements, I had the best proof in his
own, for all which (and he rated them at an immeasurable distance
compared with the subject of his eulogy) he held himself indebted
to the heir of Marwar, who was at length slain in asserting his
right to the throne in the desert.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Rām Singh and the Rāja of Narsinghgarh. The Oswāl
Mahājans.</h4>—After a four hours’ march, picking our way amidst
swamps and treacherous bogs, we reached the advanced tents
at Pallana. Like Deopur, it presented the spectacle of a ruin,
a corner of which held all its inhabitants; the remains of temples
and private edifices showed what it had once been. Both towns
formerly belonged to the fisc of the Rana, who, with his usual
improvidence, on the death of his nephew included them in the
grant to the temple of Kanhaiya. I found at my tents the
minister’s right hand, Ram Singh Mehta; Manikchand, the
Diwan or factotum of the chieftain of Bhindar; and the ex-Raja
<span class='pageno' id='Page_765'>765</span>of Narsinghgarh, now an exile at Udaipur.<a id='r4.25.7' /><a href='#f4.25.7' class='c013'><sup>[7]</sup></a> The first was a
fine specimen of the non-militant class of these countries, and
although he had seldom passed the boundaries of Mewar, no
country could produce a better specimen of a courteous gentleman:
his figure tall, deportment easy, features regular and handsome,
complexion fair, with a fine slightly-curled beard and mustachios
jet black. Ram Singh, without being conceited, is aware that
nature has been indulgent to him, and without any foppery he
pays great attention to externals. He is always elegantly attired,
and varies with good taste the colours of his turban and ceinture,
though his loose tunics are always white; the aroma of the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>itr</em></span>
is the only mark of the dandy about him: and this forms no
criterion [658], as our red coats attest, which receive a sprinkling
at every visit. With his dagger and pendent tassel, and the
<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>balaband</em></span> or purple cordon (the Rana’s gift) round his turban,
behold the servant “whom the king delighteth to honour.” As
he has to support himself by paying court to the Rana’s sister,
the queens, and other fair influentials behind the curtain, his
personal <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>attraits</em></span> are no slight auxiliaries. He is of the Jain faith,
and of the tribe of Osi, which now reckons one hundred thousand
families, all of Rajput origin, and descendants of the Agnikula
stock. They proselytized in remote antiquity, and settling at
the town of Osi in Marwar, retain this designation, or the still
more common one of Oswal. It was from the Pramara and
Solanki branches of the Agnikula race that these assumed the
doctrines of Buddha or Jaina: not however from the ranks of
the Brahmans, but, as I firmly believe, from that faith, whatever
it was, which these Scythic or Takshak tribes brought from
beyond the Indus. In like manner we found the Chauhan (also
an Agnikula) regenerated by the Brahmans on Mount Abu;
while the fourth tribe, the Parihara (ancient sovereigns of Kashmir),
have left traces in the monuments of their capital, Mandor, that
they espoused the then prevailing faith of Rajasthan, namely,
that of Buddha.<a id='r4.25.8' /><a href='#f4.25.8' class='c013'><sup>[8]</sup></a></div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Mānikchand.</h4>—Manikchand, also of the Jain faith, but of a
different tribe (the Sambhari), was in all the reverse of Ram Singh.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_766'>766</span>He was tall, thin, rather bent, and of swarthy complexion, and
his tongue and his beads were in perpetual motion. He had
mixed in all the intrigues of the last quarter of a century, and,
setting Zalim Singh of Kotah aside, had more influenced events
than any individual now alive. He was the organ of the Saktawats,
and the steward and counsellor of the head of this clan,
the Bhindar chief; and being accordingly the irreconcilable foe
of the Chondawats, had employed all the resources of his talents
and his credit to effect their humiliation. To this end, he has
leagued with Sindis, Pathans, and Mahrattas, and would not have
scrupled to coalesce with his Satanic Majesty, could he thereby
have advanced their revenge: in pursuance of which he has been
detained in confinement as a hostage, put to torture from inability
to furnish the funds he would unhesitatingly promise for
aid, and all the while sure of death if he fell into the hands of his
political antagonists. His talent and general information made
him always a welcome guest: which was wormwood to the
Chondawats, who laid claim to a monopoly of patriotism, and
stigmatized the Saktawats as the destroyers [659] of Mewar,
though in truth both were equally blind to her interests in their
contests for supremacy. He was now beyond fifty, and appeared
much older; but was cheerful, good-humoured, and conversant
in all the varied occurrences of the times. He at length completely
established himself in the Rana’s good graces, who gave
his elder son a confidential employment. Had he lived, he would
have been conspicuous, for he had all the talent of his father,
with the personal adjuncts possessed by Ram Singh; but being
sensitive and proud, he swallowed poison, in consequence it was
said of the severity of an undeserved rebuke from his father, and
died generally regretted. I may here relate the end of poor
Manika. It was on the ground we had just quitted that he
visited me for the last time, on my return from the journey just
commenced. He had obtained the contract for the whole transit
duties of the State, at the rate of 250,000 rupees per annum.
Whether from the corruption of his numerous deputy collectors,
his own cupidity, or negligence, he professed his inability to
fulfil the contract by nearly a sixth of the amount, though from
his talents and promises, a perfect establishment of this important
department, which had been taken from others on his account,
was expected. It was difficult to judge charitably of his assertions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_767'>767</span>without giving occasion to his enemies to put a wrong
construction on the motives. He pitched his tent near me, and
requested an interview. He looked very disconsolate, and
remarked, that he had seven several times left his tent, and as
often turned back, the bird of omen having each time passed
him on the adverse side; but that at length he had determined
to disregard it, as having forfeited confidence, he was indifferent
to the future. He admitted the profligacy of his inferiors, whom
he had not sufficiently superintended, and took his leave, promising
by assiduity to redeem his engagements, though his past
character for intrigue made his asseverations doubtful. Again
failing to make good his promises, or, as was surmised, having
applied the funds to his own estate, he took <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>saran</em></span> with the Raja
of Shahpura; where, mortified in all probability by the reflection
of the exultation of his rivals over his disgrace, and having lost
the confidence of his own chief when he obtained that of the
Rana, he had recourse to the usual expedient of these countries
when “perplexed in the extreme,”—took poison and died.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Rāja of Narsinghgarh.</h4>—The last of the trio of visitors on
this occasion, the Raja of Narsinghgarh, is now, as before stated,
in exile. He is of the tribe of Umat, one of thirty-six divisions
[660] of the Pramaras,<a id='r4.25.9' /><a href='#f4.25.9' class='c013'><sup>[9]</sup></a> settled during fifteen generations in Central
India, and giving the name of Umatwara to the petty sovereignty
of which Narsinghgarh is the capital. Placed in the very heart
of the predatory hordes, the Pindaris and Mahrattas occupied
almost every village that owned their sway, and compelled him
to the degradation of living under Holkar’s orange standard,
which waved over the battlements of his abode. To one or other
of the great Mahratta leaders, Sindhia and Holkar, all the petty
princes were made tributary dependents, and Umatwara had
early acknowledged Holkar, paying the annual sum of eighty
thousand rupees: but this vassalage did not secure the Raja from
the ravages of the other spoliators, nor from the rapacity of the
myrmidons of his immediate lord paramount. In 1817, when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_768'>768</span>these countries, for the first time in many centuries, tasted the
blessings of peace, Umatwara was, like Mewar, a mass of ruins,
its fertile lands being overgrown with the thorny <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>mimosa</em></span> or the
useful <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>kesula</em></span>. The Raja partook of the demoralization around
him; he sought refuge in opium and arak from his miseries, and
was totally unfitted to aid in the work of redemption when happier
days shone upon them. His son Chain Singh contrived to escape
these snares, and was found in every respect competent to cooperate
in the work of renovation, and through the intervention
of the British agent (Major Henley), an arrangement was effected
by which the Raja retired on a stipend and the son carried on
the duties of government in his name.<a id='r4.25.10' /><a href='#f4.25.10' class='c013'><sup>[10]</sup></a></div>

<p class='c001'>It was unfortunate for these ancient races, that on the fortunate
occasion presented in 1817-18, when both Sindhia and Holkar
aimed at the overthrow of our power (the one treacherously cloaking
his views, the other disclosing them in the field), our policy
did not readily grasp it, to rescue all these States from ruin and
dependence. Unfortunately, their peculiar history was little
known, or it would have been easily perceived that they presented
the exact materials we required between us and the entire
occupation of the country. But there was then a strong notion
afloat of a species of balance of power, and it was imagined that
these demoralized and often humiliated Mahrattas were the
fittest materials to throw into the scale—against I know not what,
except ourselves: for assuredly the day of our reverses will be a
jubilee to them, and will level every spear that they can bring
against our existence. They would merit contempt if they acted
[661] otherwise. Can they cease to remember that the orange
flag which waved in triumph from the Sutlej to the Kistna has
been replaced by the cross of St. George? But the snake which
flutters in tortuous folds thereon, fitting crest for the wily Mahratta,
is only scathed, and may yet call forth the lance of the red cross
knight to give the coup de grace.<a id='r4.25.11' /><a href='#f4.25.11' class='c013'><sup>[11]</sup></a> Let it then be remembered
that, both as regards good policy and justice, we owe to these
States—independence.</p>

<p class='c001'>To what does our interference with Umatwara tend, but to
realize the tribute of Holkar; to fix a millstone round their necks,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_769'>769</span>which, notwithstanding the comparative happiness they enjoy,
will keep them always repining, and to secure which will make
our interference eternal. Had a due advantage been taken of
the hostilities in 1817, it might have obviated these evils by sending
the predatory sovereign of half a century’s duration to a
more restricted sphere. It may be said that it is easy to devise
plans years after the events which immediately called for them:
these not only were mine at the time, but were suggested to the
proper authorities; and I am still disposed to think my views
correct.</p>

<p class='c001'>After chatting some time with the two chiefs described, and
presenting them with <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>itr</em></span> and <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>pan</em></span>,<a id='r4.25.12' /><a href='#f4.25.12' class='c013'><sup>[12]</sup></a> they took leave.</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Nāthdwāra.</b>—<em>October 14.</em>—Marched at daybreak, and found
the route almost impracticable for camels, from the swampy
nature of the soil. The country is much broken with irregular
low ridges of micaceous schist, in the shape of a chine or hog’s
back, the crest of which has throughout all its length a vein of
quartz piercing the slate, and resembling a back-bone; the
direction of these veins is uniformly N.N.E., and the inclination
about 75° to the east. Crossed the Nathdwara ridge, about four
hundred feet in height, and, like the hills encircling the valley,
composed of a brown granite intersected with protruding veins
of quartz, incumbent on blue compact slate. The ascent was a
mile and a half east of the town, and on the summit, which is
table-land, there are two small lakes, whence water-courses conduct
streams on each side of the road to supply the temple and
the town. There are noble trees planted on either side of these
rivulets, forming a delightful shade. As we passed through the
town to our encampment on the [662] opposite side of the Banas
River, the inhabitants crowded the streets, shouting their grateful
acknowledgments to the power which had redeemed the sacred
precincts of Kanhaiya from the scenes of turpitude amidst which
they had grown up. They were all looking forward with much
pleasure to the approaching festival of Annakuta.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_770'>770</span><em>October 15.</em>—Halted to allow the baggage to join, which,
partly from the swamps and partly from the intractable temper
of the cattle, we have not seen since we parted company at Merta.
Received a visit from the Mukhya of the temple, accompanied
by a pilgrim in the person of a rich banker of Surat. A splendid
quilted cloak of gold brocade, a blue scarf with a deep border of
gold, and an embroidered band for the head, were brought to me
as the gift of the god through his high-priest, in testimony of my
zeal. I was also honoured with a tray of the sacred food, which
consisted of all the dried fruits, spices, and aromatics of the East.
In the evening I had a portion of the afternoon repast, consisting
of a preparation of milk; but the days of simplicity are gone, and
the Apollo of Vraj has his curds adulterated with rose-water and
amber. Perhaps, with the exception of Lodi, where is fabricated
the far-famed Parmesan, whose pastures maintain forty thousand
kine, there is no other place known which possesses more than
the city of the Hindu Apollo, though but a tenth of that of Lodi.
But from the four thousand cows, the expenditure of milk and
butter for the votaries of Kanhaiya may be judged. I was entertained
with the opinions of the old banker on the miraculous and
oracular power of the god of Nathdwara. He had just been
permitted to prostrate himself before the car which conveyed the
deity from the Yamuna, and held forth on the impiety of the age,
in withholding the transmission of the miraculous wheels from
heaven, which in former days came once in six months. The
most devout alone are permitted to worship the chariot of
Kanhaiya. The garments which decorate his representative are
changed several times a day, to imitate the different stages of
his existence, from the youthful Bala to the conqueror of Kansa;
or, as the Surat devotee said in broken English, “Oh, sir, he be
much great god; he first of all; and he change from de balak,
or child, to de fierce chief, with de bow and arrow a hees hands”;
while the old Mukhya, whose office it is to perambulate the whole
continent of India as one of the couriers of Kanhaiya, lifted up
his eyes as he ejaculated, “Sri Krishna! Sri Krishna!” I gave
him a paper [663] addressed to all officers of the British Government
who might pass through the lands of the church, recommending
the protection of the peacocks and pipal trees, and to forbear
polluting the precincts of the god with the blood of animals. To
avoid offending against their prejudices in this particular, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_771'>771</span>crossed the river, and killed our fowls within our own sanctuary,
and afterwards concealed the murder by burying the feathers.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Sagacity of Elephants. Usarwās.</h4>—<em>October 16.</em>—There is
nothing so painful as sitting down inactive when the mind is
bent upon an object. Our escort was yet labouring in the swamps,
and as we could not be worse off than we were, we deemed it
better to advance, and accordingly decamped in the afternoon,
sending on a tent to Usarwas; but though the distance was only
eight miles we were benighted, and had the comfort to find old
Fateh, “the victorious,” floundering with his load in a bog, out
of which he was picking his way in a desperate rage. It is
generally the driver’s fault when such an accident occurs: for
if there be but a foot’s breadth of sound footing, so sensible is the
animal, that he is sure to avoid danger if left to his own discretion
and the free use of his proboscis, with which he thumps the
ground as he cautiously proceeds step by step, giving signals to
his keeper of the safety or the reverse of advancing, as clearly as
if he spoke. Fateh’s signals had been disregarded, and he was
accordingly in a great passion at finding himself abused, and kept
from his cakes and butter, of which he had always thirty pounds’
weight at sunset. The sagacity of the elephant is well known,
and was in no instance better displayed than in the predicament
above described. I have seen the huge monster in a position
which to him must have been appalling; but, with an instinctive
reliance on others, he awaited in tolerable patience the arrival
of materials for his extrication, in the shape of fascines and logs
of wood, which being thrown to him, he placed deliberately in
front, and making a stout resistance with head, teeth, and foot,
pressing the wood, he brought up one leg after the other in a most
methodical and pioneer-like manner, till he delivered himself
from his miry prison. Fateh did not require such aid; but,
aware that the fault was not his, he soon indignantly shook the
load off his back, and left them to get it out in any manner they
chose.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Wolves.</h4>—Waited to aid in reloading, and it being already
dusk, pushed on with my dog Belle, who, observing a couple of
animals, darted off into the jungles, and led me after her as fast
as the devious paths in such a savage scene would permit. But
I [664] soon saw her scampering down the height, the game, in
the shape of two huge wolves, close at her heels, and delighted to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_772'>772</span>find rescue at hand. I have no doubt their retreat from my
favourite greyhound was a mere <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>ruse de guerre</em></span> to lead her beyond
supporting distance, and they had nearly effected their object:
they went off in a very sulky and leisurely manner. In my
subaltern days, when with the subsidiary force in Gohad, I
remember scouring the tremendous ravines near the Antri Pass
to get a spear at a wolf, my companion (Lieut. now Lieut.-Col.
T. D. Smith) and myself were soon surrounded by many scores
of these hungry animals, who prowled about our camp all night,
having carried off a child the night before. As we charged in
one direction, they gave way; but kept upon our quarters without
the least fear, and seemingly enjoyed the fun. I do not
recollect whether it excited any other feeling than mirth. They
showed no symptom of ferocity, or desire to make a meal of us;
or a retreat from these ravines, with their superior topographical
knowledge, would doubtless have been difficult.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Banās River. The Fairy Gift Legend.</h4>—We passed the
Banas River, just escaping from the rock-bound barriers, our
path almost in contact with the water to the left. The stream
was clear as crystal, and of great depth; the banks low and
verdant, and fringed with wood. It was a lovely, lonely spot,
and well deserved to be consecrated by legendary tale. In
ancient times, ere these valleys were trod by the infidel Tatar,
coco-nuts were here presented to the genius of the river, whose
arm appeared above the waters to receive them; but ever since
some unhallowed hand threw a stone in lieu of a coco-nut, the
arm has been withdrawn.<a id='r4.25.13' /><a href='#f4.25.13' class='c013'><sup>[13]</sup></a> Few in fact lived, either to supply or
keep alive the traditions which lend a charm to a journey through
these wild scenes, though full of bogs and wolves. We reached
our journey’s end very late, and though no tents were up, we
had the consolation to spy the cook in a snug corner with a leg
of mutton before some blazing logs, round which he had placed
the wall of a tent to check the force of the mountain air. We
all congregated round the cook’s fire, and were infinitely happier
in the prospect before us, and with the heavens for our canopy,
than with all our accustomed conveniences and fare. Every one
this day had taken his own road, and each had his adventure
to relate. Our repast was delicious; nor did any favourable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_773'>773</span>account reach us of tents or other luxuries to mar our enjoyments,
till midnight, when the fly of the doctor’s tent arrived, of which
we availed ourselves as a protection against the heavy dews of
[665] the night; and though our bivouac was in a ploughed field,
and we were surrounded by wild beasts in a silent waste, they
proved no drawbacks to the enjoyment of repose.</div>

<p class='c001'>Halted the 17th, to collect the dislocated baggage; for
although such scenes, seasoned with romance, might do very well
for <em>us</em>, our followers were ignorant of the name of Ann Radcliffe
or other conjurers; and though admirers of tradition, like myself,
preferred it after dinner. Usarwas is a valuable village, but now
thinly inhabited. It was recently given by the Rana, with his
accustomed want of reflection, to a Charan bard, literally for an
old song. But even this folly was surpassed on his bestowing the
township of Sesoda,<a id='r4.25.14' /><a href='#f4.25.14' class='c013'><sup>[14]</sup></a> in the valley in advance, the place from
which his tribe takes its appellation, on another of the fraternity,
named Kishna, his master bard, who has the art to make his
royal patron believe that opportunity alone is wanting to render
his name as famed as that of the illustrious Sanga, or the immortal
Partap. I received and returned the visit of an ascetic
Sannyasi, whose hermitage was perched upon a cliff not far from
our tents. Like most of his brethren, he was intelligent, and had
a considerable store of local and foreign legends at command.
He was dressed in a loose orange-coloured anga or tunic, with a
turban of the same material, in which was twisted a necklace of
the lotus-kernel;<a id='r4.25.15' /><a href='#f4.25.15' class='c013'><sup>[15]</sup></a> he had another in his hand, with which he
repeated the name of the deity at intervals. He expressed his
own surprise and the sentiments of the inhabitants at the tranquillity
they enjoyed, without any tumultuary cause being discoverable;
and said that we must be something more than
human. This superstitious feeling for a while was felt as well by
the prince and the turbulent chief, as by the anchorite of Usarwas.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Samecha.</h4>—<em>October 18.</em>—Marched at daybreak to Samecha,
distance twelve miles. Again found our advanced elephant and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_774'>774</span>breakfast-tent in a swamp: halted to extricate him from his
difficulties. The road from Nathdwara is but a footpath, over
or skirting a succession of low broken ridges, covered with prickly
shrubs, as the Khair, the Karil, and Babul.<a id='r4.25.16' /><a href='#f4.25.16' class='c013'><sup>[16]</sup></a> At the village of
Gaon Gura, midway in the morning’s journey, we entered the
alpine valley called the Shera Nala. The village of Gura is
placed in the opening or break in the range through which the
river flows, whose serpentine meanderings indicate the only road
up this majestic valley. On the banks, or in its bed, which we
frequently crossed, lay [666] the remainder of this day’s march.
The valley varies in breadth, but is seldom less than half a mile,
the hills rising boldly from their base; some with a fine and even
surface covered with mango trees, others lifting their splintered
pinnacles into the clouds. Nature has been lavish of her beauties
to this romantic region. The <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>gular</em></span> or wild fig, the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>sitaphal</em></span> or
custard-apple, the peach or <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>aru badam</em></span> (almond-peach),<a id='r4.25.17' /><a href='#f4.25.17' class='c013'><sup>[17]</sup></a> are indigenous
and abundant; the banks of the stream are shaded by
the withy, while the large trees, the useful mango and picturesque
tamarind, the sacred pipal and bar, are abundantly scattered
with many others, throughout. Nor has nature in vain appealed
to human industry and ingenuity to second her intents.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Terrace Cultivation.</h4>—From the margin of the stream on each
side to the mountain’s base they have constructed a series of
terraces rising over each other, whence by simple and ingenious
methods they raise the waters to irrigate the rich crops of sugar-cane,
cotton, and rice, which they cultivate upon them. Here
we have a proof that ingenuity is the same, when prompted by
necessity, in the Jura or the Aravalli. Wherever soil could be
found, or time decomposed these primitive rocks, a barrier was
raised. When discovered, should it be in a hollow below, or on
the summit of a crag, it is alike greedily seized on: even there
water is found, and if you leave the path below and ascend a
hundred feet above the terraces, you will discover pools or
reservoirs dammed in with massive trees, which serve to irrigate
such insulated spots, or serve as nurseries to the young rice-plants.
Not unfrequently, their labour is entirely destroyed,
and the dykes swept away by the periodical inundations; for
we observed the high-water mark in the trees considerably up the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_775'>775</span>acclivity. The rice crop was abundant, and the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>juar</em></span> [millet] or
maize was thriving, but scanty; the standard autumnal crop
which preceded it, the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>makai</em></span>, or ‘Indian corn,’ had been entirely
devoured by the locust. The sugar-cane, by far the most valuable
product of this curious region, was very fine but sparingly
cultivated, from the dread of this insect, which for the last three
years had ravaged the valley. There are two species of locusts,
which come in clouds, darkening the air, from the desert: the
<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>pharka</em></span> and the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>tiri</em></span> are their names;<a id='r4.25.18' /><a href='#f4.25.18' class='c013'><sup>[18]</sup></a> the first is the great enemy
of our incipient prosperity. I observed a colony some time ago
proceeding eastward with a rustling, rushing sound, like a distant
torrent, or the wind in a forest at the fall of the leaf. We have
thus to struggle against natural and artificial obstacles to the
rising energies of the country; and dread of the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>pharkas</em></span> deters
speculators [667] from renting this fertile tract, which almost
entirely belongs to the fisc. Its natural fertility cannot be better
demonstrated than in recording the success of an experiment,
which produced five crops, from the same piece of ground, within
thirteen months. It must, however, be understood that two of
these are species of millet, which are cut in six weeks from the
time of sowing. A patch of ground, for which the cultivator
pays six rupees rent, will produce sugar-cane six hundred rupees
in value: but the labour and expense of cultivation are heavy,
and cupidity too often deprives the husbandman of the greater
share of the fruits, ninety rupees having been taken in arbitrary
taxes, besides his original rent.</div>

<p class='c001'>The air of this elevated region gave vigour to the limbs, and
appetite to the disordered stomach. There was an exhilarating
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>fraîcheur</em></span>, which made us quite frantic; the transition being from
96° of Fahrenheit to English summer heat. We breakfasted in a
verdant spot under the shade of a noble fig-tree fanned by the
cool breezes from the mountains.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Samecha Town. Rājpūt Bhūmias.</h4>—Samecha consists of three
separate hamlets, each of about one hundred houses. It is
situated at the base of a mountain distinctively termed Rana
Pag, from a well-known path, by which the Ranas secured their
retreat to the upland wilds when hard pushed by the Moguls.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_776'>776</span>It also leads direct to the capital of the district, avoiding the
circuitous route we were pursuing. Samecha is occupied by the
Kumbhawats, descendants of Rana Kumbha, who came in a
body with their elders at their head to visit me, bringing the famed
<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>kakri</em></span><a id='r4.25.19' /><a href='#f4.25.19' class='c013'><sup>[19]</sup></a> of the valley (often three feet in length), curds, and a kid
as gifts. I rose to receive these Rajaputras, the Bhumias or
yeomen of the valley; and though undistinguishable in dress
from the commonest cultivator, I did homage to their descent.
Indeed, they did not require the auxiliaries of dress, their appearance
being so striking as to draw forth the spontaneous exclamation
from my friends, “what noble-looking fellows!” Their
tall and robust figures, sharp aquiline features, and flowing beards,
with a native dignity of demeanour (though excepting their
chiefs, who wore turbans and scarfs, they were in their usual
labouring dresses, immense loose breeches and turbans), compelled
respect and admiration. Formerly they gave one hundred
matchlocks for garrison duty at Kumbhalmer; but the Mahrattas
have pillaged and impoverished them. These are the real allodial
tenants of the land, performing personal local service, and paying
an annual quit-rent. I conciliated their good opinion by [668]
talking of the deeds of old days, the recollection of which a Rajput
never outlives. The assembly under the fig-tree was truly
picturesque, and would have furnished a good subject for Gerard
Dow. Our baggage joined us at Samecha; but many of our
camels were already worn out by labouring through swamps, for
which they are by nature incapacitated.</div>

<p class='c001'><em>October 19.</em>—Marched to Kelwara, the capital of this mountainous
region, and the abode of the Ranas when driven from
Chitor and the plains of the Banas; on which occasion these
valleys received and maintained a great portion of the population
of Mewar. There is not a rock or a stream that has not some
legend attached to it, connected with these times. The valley
presents the same features as already described. Passed a cleft
in the mountain on the left, through which a stream rushes,
called the “elephant’s pool”; a short cut may be made by the
foot passenger to Kelwara, but it is too intricate for any unaccustomed
to these wilds to venture. We could not ascertain
the origin of the “elephant’s pool,” but it is most likely connected
with ancient warfare. Passed the village of Murcha, held by a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_777'>777</span>Rathor chieftain. On the margin of a small lake adjoining the
village, a small and very neat sacrificial altar attracted my regard;
and not satisfied with the reply that it was <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>sati ka makan</em></span>, ‘the
place of faith,’ I sent to request the attendance of the village
seer. It proved to be that of the ancestor of the occupant: a
proof of devotion to her husband, who had fallen in the wars
waged by Aurangzeb against this country; when, with a relic of
her lord, she mounted the pyre. He is sculptured on horseback,
with lance at rest, to denote that it is no churl to whom the record
is devoted.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Near the “elephant’s pool,” and at the village of Kherli, two
roads diverge: one, by the Bargula <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>nal</em></span> or pass, conducts direct
to Nathdwara; the other, leading to Rincher, and the celebrated
shrine of the four-armed god,<a id='r4.25.20' /><a href='#f4.25.20' class='c013'><sup>[20]</sup></a> famed as a place of pilgrimage.
The range on our left terminating abruptly, we turned by Uladar
to Kelwara, and encamped in a mango-grove, on a tableland half
a mile north of the town. Here the valley enlarges, presenting
a wild, picturesque, and rugged appearance. The barometer
indicated about a thousand feet of elevation above the level of
Udaipur, which is about two thousand above the sea: yet we
were scarcely above the base of the alpine cliffs which towered
around us on all sides. It was the point of divergence for the
waters, which, from the numerous fountains in [669] these uplands,
descended each declivity, to refresh the arid plains of
Marwar to the west, and to swell the lakes of Mewar to the east.
Previous to the damming of the stream which forms that little
ocean, the Kankroli lake, it is asserted that the supply to the
west was very scanty, nearly all flowing eastward, or through the
valley; but since the formation of the lake, and consequent
saturation of the intermediate region, the streams are ever
flowing to the west. The spot where I encamped was at least
five hundred feet lower than Aret pol, the first of the fortified
barriers leading to Kumbhalmer, whose citadel rose more than
seven hundred feet above the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>terre-pleine</em></span> of its outworks beneath.</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Kūmbhalmer Fort. Mahārāja Daulat Singh.</b>—The Maharaja
Daulat Singh, a near relative of the Rana, and governor of
Kumbhalmer, attended by a numerous suite, the crimson standard,
trumpets, kettledrums, seneschal, and bard, advanced several
miles to meet and conduct me to the castle. According to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_778'>778</span>etiquette, we both dismounted and embraced, and afterwards
rode together conversing on the affairs of the province, and the
generally altered condition of the country. Daulat Singh, being
of the immediate kin of his sovereign, is one of the Babas or
infants of Mewar, enumerated in the tribe called Ranawat, with
the title of Maharaja. Setting aside the family of Sheodan
Singh, he is the next in succession to the reigning family. He is
one of the few over whom the general demoralization has had
no power, and remains a simple-minded straightforward honest
man; blunt, unassuming, and courteous. His rank and character
particularly qualify him for the post he holds on this western
frontier, which is the key to Marwar. It was in February 1818
that I obtained possession of this place (Kumbhalmer), by
negotiating the arrears of the garrison. Gold is the cheapest,
surest, and most expeditious of all generals in the East, amongst
such mercenaries as we had to deal with, who change masters
with the same facility as they would their turban. In twenty-four
hours we were put in possession of the fort, and as we had not
above one-third of the stipulated sum in ready cash, they without
hesitation took a bill of exchange, written on the drum-head, on
the mercantile town of Pali in Marwar: in such estimation is
British faith held, even by the most lawless tribes of India! Next
morning we saw them winding down the western declivity, while
we quietly took our breakfast in an old ruined temple. During
this agreeable employment, we were joined by Major Macleod,
of the artillery, sent by General Donkin to report on the facilities
of reducing the place by siege, and [670] his opinion being, that
a gun could not be placed in position in less than six weeks, the
grilling spared the European force in such a region was well worth
the £4000 of arrears. My own escort and party remained in
possession for a week, until the Rana sent his garrison. During
these eight days our time was amply occupied in sketching and
deciphering the monumental records of this singularly diversified
spot. It would be vain to attempt describing the intricacies of
approach to this far-famed abode, whose exterior is delineated
by the pencil. A massive wall, with numerous towers and
pierced battlements, having a strong resemblance to the Etruscan,
encloses a space of some miles extent below, while the pinnacle
or <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>sikhara</em></span> rises, like the crown of the Hindu Cybele, tier above
tier of battlements, to the summit, which is crowned with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_779'>779</span>Badal Mahall, or ‘cloud-palace’ of the Ranas. Thence the
eye ranges over the sandy deserts and the chaotic mass of
mountains, which are on all sides covered with the cactus, which
luxuriates amidst the rocks of the Aravalli. Besides the Aret<a id='r4.25.21' /><a href='#f4.25.21' class='c013'><sup>[21]</sup></a>
pol, or barrier thrown across the first narrow ascent, about one
mile from Kelwara, there is a second called the Halla<a id='r4.25.22' /><a href='#f4.25.22' class='c013'><sup>[22]</sup></a> pol,
intermediate to the Hanuman<a id='r4.25.23' /><a href='#f4.25.23' class='c013'><sup>[23]</sup></a> pol, the exterior gate of the fortress,
between which and the summit there are three more, viz. the
gate of victory, the sanguinary gate, and that of Rama, besides
the last, or Chaugan<a id='r4.25.24' /><a href='#f4.25.24' class='c013'><sup>[24]</sup></a> pol. The barometer stood, at half-past
seven <span class='fss'>A.M.</span>, 26° 65´; thermometer 58° Fahr. at the Aret pol: and
on the summit at nine, while the thermometer rose to 75°, the
barometer had only descended 15´, and stood at 26° 50´,<a id='r4.25.25' /><a href='#f4.25.25' class='c013'><sup>[25]</sup></a> though
we had ascended full six hundred feet.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>A Jain Temple.</h4>—Admitting the last range as our guide, the peak
of Kumbhalmer will be 3353<a id='r4.25.26' /><a href='#f4.25.26' class='c013'><sup>[26]</sup></a> feet above the level of the ocean.
Hence I laid down the positions of many towns far in the desert.
Here were subjects to occupy the pencil at least for a month; but
we had only time for one of the most interesting views, the Jain
temple before the reader, and a sketch of the fortress itself, both
finished on the spot. The design of this temple is truly classic.
It consists only of the sanctuary, which has a vaulted dome and
colonnaded portico all round. The architecture is undoubtedly
Jain, which is as distinct in character from the Brahmanical
as their religion. There is a chasteness and simplicity in this
specimen of monotheistic worship, affording a wide contrast to
the elaborately sculptured shrines of the Saivas, and [671] other
polytheists of India. The extreme want of decoration best
attests its antiquity, entitling us to attribute it to that period
when Samprati Raja, of the family of Chandragupta, was paramount
sovereign over all these regions (two hundred years before
Christ);<a id='r4.25.27' /><a href='#f4.25.27' class='c013'><sup>[27]</sup></a> to whom tradition ascribes the most ancient monuments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_780'>780</span>of this faith, yet existing in Rajasthan and Saurashtra.
The proportions and forms of the columns are especially distinct
from the other temples, being slight and tapering instead of
massive, the general characteristic of Hindu architecture; while
the projecting cornices, which would absolutely deform shafts
less slight, are peculiarly indicative of the Takshak architect.<a id='r4.25.28' /><a href='#f4.25.28' class='c013'><sup>[28]</sup></a>
Samprati was the fourth prince in descent from Chandragupta,
of the Jain faith, and the ally of Seleucus, the Grecian sovereign
of Bactriana. The fragments of Megasthenes, ambassador from
Seleucus, record that this alliance was most intimate; that the
daughter of the Rajput king was married to Seleucus, who, in
return for elephants and other gifts, sent a body of Greek soldiers
to serve Chandragupta. It is curious to contemplate the possibility,
nay the probability, that the Jain temple now before the
reader may have been designed by Grecian artists, or that the
taste of the artists among the Rajputs may have been modelled
after the Grecian. This was our temple of Theseus in Mewar.
A massive monolithic emblem of black marble of the Hindu
Pitrideva had been improperly introduced into the shrine of the
worshippers of the “spirit alone.” Being erected on the rock,
and chiselled from the syenite on which it stands, it may bid
defiance to time. There was another sacred structure in its
vicinity, likewise Jain, but of a distinct character; indeed,
offering a perfect contrast to that described. It was three stories
in height; each tier was decorated with numerous massive low
columns, resting on a sculptured panelled parapet, and sustaining
the roof of each story, which, being very low, admitted but a
broken light to break the pervading gloom. I should imagine
that the sacred architects of the East had studied effect equally
with the preservers of learning and the arts in the dark period of
Europe, when those monuments, which must ever be her pride,
arose on the ruins of paganism. How far the Saxon or Scandinavian
pagan contributed to the general design of such structures
may be doubted; but that their decorations, especially the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_781'>781</span>grotesque, have a powerful resemblance to the most ancient
Hindu-Scythic, there is no question, as I shall hereafter more
particularly point out [672].</div>

<p class='c001'>Who, that has a spark of imagination, but has felt the indescribable
emotion which the gloom and silence of a Gothic
cathedral excites? The very extent provokes a comparison
humiliating to the pigmy spectator, and this is immeasurably
increased when the site is the mountain pinnacle, where man and
his works fade into nothing in contemplating the magnificent
expanse of nature. The Hindu priest did not raise the temple
for heterogeneous multitudes: he calculated that the mind
would be more highly excited when left to its solitary devotions,
amidst the silence of these cloistered columns, undisturbed save
by the monotony of the passing bell, while the surrounding gloom
is broken only by the flare of the censer as the incense mounts
above the altar.</p>

contracting gorge is lost in distance, the gradually diminishing
space is filled with masses of ruin. I will only notice two of the
most interesting. The first is dedicated to Mama Devi, ‘the
mother of the gods,’ whose shrine is on the brow of the mountain
overlooking the pass. The goddess is placed in the midst of her
numerous family, including the greater and lesser divinities.
They are all of the purest marble, each about three feet in height,
and tolerably executed, though evidently since the decline of
the art, of which very few good specimens exist executed within
the last seven centuries. The temple is very simple and primitive,
consisting but of a long hall, around which the gods are ranged,
without either niche or altar.</div>

<p class='c001'>The most interesting portion of this temple is its court, formed
by a substantial wall enclosing a tolerable area. The interior
of this wall had been entirely covered with immense tables of
black marble, on which was inscribed the history of their gods,
and, what was of infinitely greater importance, that of the mortal
princes who had erected the tablets in their honour. But what
a sight for the antiquary! Not one of the many tables was
entire; the fragments were strewed about, or placed in position
<span class='pageno' id='Page_782'>782</span>to receive the flesh-pots of the sons of Ishmael, the mercenary
Rohilla Afghan [673].<a id='r4.25.29' /><a href='#f4.25.29' class='c013'><sup>[29]</sup></a></p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Memorial of Prithirāj and Tāra Bāi.</h4>—On quitting the temple
of Mama Devi, my attention was attracted by a simple monumental
shrine on the opposite side of the valley, and almost
in the gorge of the pass. It was most happily situated, being
quite isolated, overlooking the road leading to Marwar, and
consisted of a simple dome of very moderate dimensions, supported
by columns, without any intervening object to obstruct
the view of the little monumental altar arising out of the centre
of the platform. It was the Sybilline temple of Tivoli in miniature.
To it, over rock and ruin, I descended. Here repose the
ashes of the Troubadour of Mewar, the gallant Prithiraj and his
heroine wife, Tara Bai, whose lives and exploits fill many a page
of the legendary romances of Mewar.</div>

<p>RUINS IN KŪMBHALMER.<br /><span class='small'><em>To face page 782.</em></span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>This fair ‘star’ (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>tara</em></span>) was the daughter of Rao Surthan, the
chieftain of Badnor. He was of the Solanki tribe, the lineal
descendant of the famed Balhara kings of Anhilwara. Thence
expelled by the arms of Ala in the thirteenth century, they
migrated to Central India, and obtained possession of Tonk-Toda
and its lands on the Banas, which from remote times
had been occupied (perhaps founded) by the Taks, and hence
bore the name of Taksilanagar, familiarly Takatpur and Toda.<a id='r4.25.30' /><a href='#f4.25.30' class='c013'><sup>[30]</sup></a>
Surthan had been deprived of Toda by Lila the Afghan, and now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_783'>783</span>occupied Badnor at the foot of the Aravalli, within the bounds
of Mewar. Stimulated by the reverses of her family, and by the
incentives of its ancient glory, Tara Bai, scorning the habiliments
and occupations of her sex, learned to guide the war-horse, and
throw with unerring aim the arrow from his back, even while at
speed. Armed with the bow and quiver, and mounted on a fiery
Kathiawar, she joined the cavalcade in their unsuccessful
attempts to wrest Toda from the Afghan. Jaimall, the third son
of Rana Raemall, in person made proposals for her hand.
“Redeem Toda,” said the star of Badnor, “and my hand is
thine.” He assented to the terms: but evincing a rude determination
to be possessed of the prize ere he had earned it, he was
slain by the indignant father. Prithiraj, the brother of the
deceased, was then in exile in Marwar; he had just signalized
his valour, and ensured his father’s forgiveness, the redemption
of Godwar,<a id='r4.25.31' /><a href='#f4.25.31' class='c013'><sup>[31]</sup></a> and the [674] catastrophe at Badnor determined
him to accept the gage thrown down to Jaimall. Fame and the
bard had carried the renown of Prithiraj far beyond the bounds
of Mewar; the name alone was attractive to the fair, and when
thereto he who bore it added all the chivalrous ardour of his
prototype, the Chauhan, Tara Bai, with the sanction of her father,
consented to be his, on the simple asseveration that “he would
restore to them Toda, or he was no true Rajput.” The anniversary
of the martyrdom of the sons of Ali was the season chosen
for the exploit.<a id='r4.25.32' /><a href='#f4.25.32' class='c013'><sup>[32]</sup></a> Prithiraj formed a select band of five hundred
cavaliers, and accompanied by his bride, the fair Tara, who
insisted on partaking his glory and his danger, he reached Toda
at the moment the <i>ta’aziya</i> or bier containing the martyr-brothers
was placed in the centre of the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>chauk</em></span> or ‘square.’ The prince,
Tara Bai, and the faithful Sengar chief, the inseparable companion
of Prithiraj, left their cavalcade and joined the procession as it
passed under the balcony of the palace in which the Afghan was
putting on his dress preparatory to descending. Just as he had
asked who were the strange horsemen that had joined the throng,
the lance of Prithiraj and an arrow from the bow of his Amazonian
bride stretched him on the floor. Before the crowd recovered
from the panic, the three had reached the gate of the town, where
their exit was obstructed by an elephant. Tara Bai with her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_784'>784</span>scimitar divided his trunk, and the animal flying, they joined
their cavalcade, which was close at hand.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Afghans were encountered, and could not stand the attack.
Those who did not fly were cut to pieces; and the gallant
Prithiraj inducted the father of his bride into his inheritance. A
brother of the Afghans, in his attempt to recover it, lost his life.
The Nawab Mallu Khan then holding Ajmer determined to
oppose the Sesodia prince in person; who, resolved upon being the
assailant, advanced to Ajmer, encountered his foe in the camp
at daybreak, and after great slaughter entered Garh Bitli, the
citadel, with the fugitives. “By these acts,” says the chronicle,
“his fame increased in Rajwara: one thousand Rajputs, animated
by the same love of glory and devotion, gathered round the
<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>nakkaras</em></span> of Prithiraj. Their swords shone in the heavens, and
were dreaded on the earth; but they aided the defenceless.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Another story is recorded and confirmed by Muhammadan
writers as to the result, though they are ignorant of the impulse
which prompted the act. Prithiraj on some [675] occasion
found the Rana conversing familiarly with an ahadi<a id='r4.25.33' /><a href='#f4.25.33' class='c013'><sup>[33]</sup></a> of the
Malwa king, and feeling offended at the condescension, expressed
himself with warmth. The Rana ironically replied: “You are
a mighty seizer of kings; but for me, I desire to retain my land.”
Prithiraj abruptly retired, collected his band, made for Nimach,
where he soon gathered five thousand horse, and reaching Dipalpur,
plundered it, and slew the governor. The king on hearing
of the irruption left Mandu at the head of what troops he could
collect; but the Rajput prince, in lieu of retreating, rapidly
advanced and attacked the camp while refreshing after the
march. Singling out the royal tent, occupied by eunuchs and
females, the king was made captive, and placed on an express
camel beside the prince, who warned the pursuers to follow
peaceably, or he would put his majesty to death; adding that
he intended him no harm, but that after having made him “touch
his father’s feet,” he should restore him to liberty. Having
carried him direct to Chitor and to his father’s presence, he
turned to him saying, “Send for your friend the ahadi, and ask
<span class='pageno' id='Page_785'>785</span>him who this is?” The Malwa king was detained a month
within the walls of Chitor, and having paid his ransom in horses,
was set at liberty with every demonstration of honour.<a id='r4.25.34' /><a href='#f4.25.34' class='c013'><sup>[34]</sup></a> Prithiraj
returned to Kumbhalmer, his residence, and passed his life in
exploits like these from the age of fourteen to twenty-three, the
admiration of the country and the theme of the bard.</p>

<p class='c001'>It could not be expected that long life would be the lot of one
who thus courted distinction, though it was closed neither by
shot nor sabre, but by poison, when on the eve of prosecuting
his unnatural feud against his brother Sanga, the place of whose
retreat was made known by his marriage with the daughter of
the chieftain of Srinagar, who had dared to give him protection
in defiance of his threats.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the same time he received a letter from his sister, written
in great grief, complaining of the barbarous treatment of her lord,
the Sirohi prince, from whose tyranny she begged to be delivered
and to be restored to the paternal roof; since whenever he had
indulged too freely in the ‘essence of the flower,’ or in opium, he
used to place her under the bedstead, and leave her to sleep on
the floor. Prithiraj instantly departed, reached Sirohi at midnight,
scaled the palace, and interrupted the repose of Pabhu
Rao by placing his poniard at his throat. His wife, notwithstanding
his cruelty, complied with his humiliating appeal for
mercy, and begged his life, which was granted on condition of
his standing as a suppliant with his wife’s [676] shoes on his head,
and touching her feet, the lowest mark of degradation. He
obeyed, was forgiven, and embraced by Prithiraj, who became
his guest during five days. Pabhu Rao was celebrated for a confection,
of which he presented some to his brother at parting.
He partook of it as he came in sight of Kumbhalmer; but on
reaching the shrine of Mama Devi was unable to proceed. Here
he sent a message to the fair Tara to come and bid him farewell;
but so subtle was the poison, that death had overtaken him ere
she descended from the citadel. Her resolution was soon formed;
the pyre was erected, and with the mortal remains of the chivalrous
Prithiraj in her embrace, she sought “the regions of the sun.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_786'>786</span>Such the end of the Sesodia prince, and the star of Badnor.
From such instances we must form our opinion of the manners
of these people. But for the poisoned confection of the chief
of Sirohi, Prithiraj would have had the glory of opposing himself
to Babur, instead of his heroic brother and successor, Sanga.<a id='r4.25.35' /><a href='#f4.25.35' class='c013'><sup>[35]</sup></a>
Whether, from his superior ardour of temperament, and the love
of military glory which attracted similarly constituted minds to
his fortunes, he would have been more successful than his brother,
it is futile to conjecture.</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Frontier of Mārwār.</b>—<em>October 20.</em>—Halted till noon, that
the men might dress their dinners, and prepare for the descent
into “the region of death,” or Marwar. The pass by which we
had to gain it was represented as terrific; but as both horse and
elephant, with the aid of the hatchet, will pick their way wherever
man can go, we determined to persevere. Struck the camp at
noon, when the baggage filed off, halting ourselves till three;
the escort and advanced tents, and part of the cuisine being
ordered to clear the pass, while we designed to spend the night
midway, in a spot forming the natural boundary of Mewar and
Marwar, reported to be sufficiently capacious. Rumour had not
magnified the difficulties of the descent, which we found strewed
with our baggage, arresting all progress for a full hour. For
nearly a mile there was but just breadth sufficient to admit the
passage of a loaded elephant, the descent being at an angle of 55°
with the horizon, and streams on either side rushing with a
deafening roar over their rugged beds. As we gained a firmer
footing at the base of this first descent, we found that the gallant
Manika, the gift of my friend the Bundi prince, had missed his
footing and rolled down the steep, breaking the cantle of the
saddle; a little farther appeared the cook, hanging in dismay
over the scattered implements of his art, his camel remonstrating
against the [677] replacing of his <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>kajavas</em></span> or panniers. For
another mile it became more gentle, when we passed under a
tower of Kumbhalmer, erected on a scarped projection of the
rock, full five hundred feet above us. The scenery was magnificent;
the mountains rising on each side in every variety of form,
and their summits, as they caught a ray of the departing sun,
reflecting on our sombre path a momentary gleam from the
masses of rose-coloured quartz which crested them. Noble
<span class='pageno' id='Page_787'>787</span>forest trees covered every face of the hills and the bottom of the
glen, through which, along the margin of the serpentine torrent
which we repeatedly crossed, lay our path. Notwithstanding
all our mishaps, partly from the novelty and grandeur of the
scene, and partly from the invigorating coolness of the air, our
mirth became wild and clamorous: a week before I was oppressed
with a thousand ills; and now I trudged the rugged path, leaping
the masses of granite which had rolled into the torrent.</p>

<p class='c001'>There was one spot where the waters formed a pool or <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>dah</em></span>.
Little Carey determined to trust to his pony to carry him across,
but deviating to the left, just as I was leaping from a projecting
ledge, to my horror, horse and rider disappeared. The shock
was momentary, and a good ducking the only result, which in the
end was the luckiest thing that could have befallen him. On
reaching the Hathidarra, or ‘barrier of the elephant’ (a very
appropriate designation for a mass of rock serving as a rampart
to shut up the pass), where we had intended to remain the night,
we found no spot capacious enough even for a single tent. Orders
accordingly passed to the rear for the baggage to collect there,
and wait the return of day to continue the march. The shades
of night were fast descending, and we proceeded almost in utter
darkness towards the banks of the stream, the roar of whose
waters was our guide, and not a little perplexed by the tumultuous
rush which issued from every glen, to join that we were seeking.
Towards the termination of the descent the path became wider,
and the voice of the waters of a deeper and hoarser tone, as they
glided to gain the plains of Marwar. The vault of heaven, in
which there was not a cloud, appeared as an arch to the perpendicular
cliffs surrounding us on all sides, and the stars beamed
with peculiar brilliancy from the confined space through which
we viewed them. As we advanced in perfect silence, fancy busily
at work on what might befall our straggling retinue from the
ferocious tiger or plundering mountaineer, a gleam of light
suddenly flashed upon us on emerging from the brushwood, and
disclosed a party of dismounted cavaliers seated round their
night-fires under some magnificent fig-trees [678].<a id='r4.5.36' /><a href='#f4.5.36' class='c013'><sup>[36]</sup></a></p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Meeting with the Mers.</h4>—Halted, and called a council of war
to determine our course: we had gained the spot our guides had
assigned as the only fitting one for bivouac before we reached the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_788'>788</span>plains beyond the mountains; it afforded shade from the dews,
and plenty of water. The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>munitions de bouche</em></span> having gone on
was a good argument that we should follow; but darkness and
five miles more of intricate forest, through a path from which
the slightest deviation, right or left, might lead us into the jaws
of a tiger, or the toils of the equally savage Mer, decided us to
halt. We now took another look at the group above-mentioned.
Though the excitement of the morning was pretty well chilled
by cold and hunger (poor sharpeners of the imagination), it was
impossible to contemplate the scene before us without a feeling
of the highest interest. From twenty-five to thirty tall figures,
armed at all points, were sitting or reposing in groups round their
watch-fires, conversing and passing the pipe from hand to hand,
while their long black locks, and motley-fashioned turbans, told
that they belonged to Marudesa. A rude altar, raised in honour
of some “gentle blood” shed by the murky mountaineer, served
as a place of rest for the chief of the party, distinguished by the
gold band in his turban, and his deer-skin doublet. I gave the
usual salutation of “Rama, Rama,” to the chief and his party,
and inquired after the health of their chieftain of Ghanerao, to
whose courtesy I found I owed this mark of attention. This
was the boundary between the two States of Marwar and Mewar,
since the district of Godwar was lost by the latter about fifty
years ago. The spot has been the scene of many a conflict, and
a closer approach disclosed several other altars raised in honour
of the slain; each represented a cavalier mounted on his war-steed,
with his lance poised, denoting that in such attitude he
fell in defending the pass, or redeeming the cattle from the
plundering mountain Mer. A square tablet placed on each contained
the date on which he gained “the mansions of the sun.”
Midnight being past, and bringing no hope of our appetites
growing by what they might feed upon, Dr. Duncan and Captain
Waugh took the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>jhul</em></span>, or broadcloth-housing, from the elephant,
and rolling themselves in it, followed the example of the chieftain
and reposed upon the ashes of the brave, on an altar adjoining
the one he occupied. I soon left them in happy forgetfulness of
tigers, Meras, hunger, and all the fatigues of the day, and joined
the group to listen to the tale with which they enlivened the
midnight hour. This I can repeat, but it would have required
the pencil of a master to paint the scene. It was a subject for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_789'>789</span>Salvator Rosa; though I should [679] have been perfectly
satisfied with one of Captain Waugh’s delineations, had he been
disposed at that moment to exert the pictorial art. Several of
my friends had encountered the mountaineer on this very spot;
and these humble cenotaphs, covering the ashes of their kin,
recalled events not likely to be repeated in these halcyon days,
when the names of Bhil and Mer cease to be the synonyms of
plunderer. As there may be no place more appropriate for a
sketch of the mountaineers, the reader may transport himself to
the glen of Kumbhalmer, and listen to the history of one of the
aboriginal tribes of Rajasthan [680].</div>

<h3 class='c024'>CHAPTER 26</h3>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Mer Tribe.</h4>—The Mer or Mera is the mountaineer of Rajputana,
and the country he inhabits is styled Merwara, or ‘the
region of hills.’ The epithet is therefore merely local, for the
Mer is but a branch of the Mina or Maina, one of the aborigines
of India. He is also called Merot and Merawat; but these
terminations only more correctly define his character of mountaineer.<a id='r4.26.1' /><a href='#f4.26.1' class='c013'><sup>[1]</sup></a>
Merwara is that portion of the Aravalli chain between
Kumbhalmer and Ajmer, a space of about ninety miles in length,
and varying in breadth from six to twenty. The general character
of this magnificent rampart, in the natural and physical geography
of Rajputana, is now sufficiently familiar. It rises from three to
four thousand feet above the level of the sea, and abounds with a
variety of natural productions. In short, I know no portion of
the globe which would yield to the scientific traveller more
abundant materials for observation than the alpine Aravalli.
The architectural antiquary might fill his portfolio, and natural
history would receive additions to her page in every department,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_790'>790</span>and especially in botany and zoology.<a id='r4.26.2' /><a href='#f4.26.2' class='c013'><sup>[2]</sup></a> I [681] should know no
higher gratification than to be of a scientific party to anatomize
completely this important portion of India. I would commence
on the Gujarat, and finish on the Shaikhawat frontier. The
party should consist of a skilful surveyor, to lay down on a large
scale a topographical chart of the mountains; several gentlemen
thoroughly versed in natural history; able architectural and
landscape draughtsmen, and the antiquary to transcribe ancient
inscriptions, as well as to depict the various races. The “Aravalli
delineated,” by the hand of science, would form a most instructive
and delightful work.</div>

<p class='c001'>A minute account of the Mer, his habits and his history, would
be no unimportant feature: but as this must be deferred, I will,
in the meanwhile, furnish some details to supply the void.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Mers are a branch of the Chitas, an important division of
the Minas.<a id='r4.26.3' /><a href='#f4.26.3' class='c013'><sup>[3]</sup></a> I shall elsewhere enter at large into the history of
this race, which consists of as many branches as their conquerors,
the Rajputs. All these wild races have the vanity to mingle
their pedigree with that of their conquerors, though in doing so
they stigmatize themselves. The Chita-Minas accordingly claim
descent from a grandson of the last Chauhan emperor of Delhi.
Anhul and Anup were the sons of Lakha, the nephew of the
Chauhan king. The coco-nut was sent from Jaisalmer, offering
princesses of that house in marriage: but an investigation into
their maternal ancestry disclosed that they were the issue of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_791'>791</span>Mina concubine: and their birth being thus revealed, they became
exiles from Ajmer, and associates with their maternal relatives.</p>

<p class='c001'>Anhul espoused the daughter of a Mina chieftain, by whom
he had Chita, whose descendants enjoy almost a monopoly of
power in Merwara. The sons of Chita, who occupied the northern
frontier near Ajmer, became Muhammadans about fifteen generations
ago, when Duda, the sixteenth from the founder of the race,
was created Dawad Khan by the Hakim of Ajmer; and as
Hathun was his residence, the “Khan of Hathun” signified the
chief of the Merots. Chang, Jhak, and Rajosi are the principal
towns adjoining Hathun. Anup also took a Mina wife, by whom
he had Barar, whose descendants have continued true [682] to
their original tenets. Their chief places are Barar, Berawara,
Mandila, etc. Though the progeny of these Minas may have been
improved by the infusion of Rajput blood, they were always
notorious for their lawless habits, and for the importance attached
to them so far back as the period of Bisaldeo, the celebrated prince
of Ajmer, whom the bard Chand states to have reduced them to
submission, making them “carry water in the streets of Ajmer.”
Like all mountaineers, they of course broke out whenever the
hands of power were feeble. In the battle between the Chauhans
of Ajmer and the Parihars of Mandor, a body of four thousand
Mer bowmen served Nahar Rao, and defended the pass of the
Aravalli against Prithiraj in this his first essay in arms. Chand
thus describes them:<a id='r4.26.4' /><a href='#f4.26.4' class='c013'><sup>[4]</sup></a> “Where hill joins hill, the Mer and Mina
thronged. The Mandor chief commanded that the pass should
be defended—four thousand heard and obeyed, each in form as
the angel of death—men who never move without the omen,
whose arrow never flies in vain—with frames like India’s bolt—faithful
to their word, preservers of the land and the honour<a id='r4.26.5' /><a href='#f4.26.5' class='c013'><sup>[5]</sup></a> of
Mandor; whose fortresses have to this day remained unconquered—who
bring the spoils of the plains to their dwellings. Of these
in the dark recesses of the mountains four thousand lay concealed,
their crescent-formed arrows beside them. Like the envenomed
serpent, they wait in silence the advance of the foe.</p>

<div class='section-start'><span class='pageno' id='Page_792'>792</span><h4 class='disp-inline'>Prithirāj attacks the Mers.</h4>—“Tidings reached the Chauhan
that the manly Mina, with bow in hand, stood in the mountain’s
gorge. Who would be bold enough to force it? his rage was like
the hungry lion’s when he views his prey. He called the brave
Kana, and bade him observe those wretches as he commanded
him to clear the pass. Bowing he departed, firm as the rock on
which he trod. He advanced, but the mountaineer (Mer) was
immovable as Sumeru. Their arrows, carrying death, fly like
Indra’s bolts—they obscure the sun. Warriors fall from their
steeds, resounding in their armour as a tree torn up by the blast.
Kana quits the steed; hand to hand he encounters the foe; the
feathery shafts, as they strike fire, appear like birds escaping
from the flames. The lance flies through the breast, appearing
at the back [683], like a fish escaping through the meshes of a
net. The evil spirits dance in the mire of blood. The hero of
the mountain<a id='r4.26.6' /><a href='#f4.26.6' class='c013'><sup>[6]</sup></a> encountered Kana, and his blow made him reel;
but like lightning it was returned, and the mountaineer fell: the
crash was as the shaking of Sumeru. At this moment Nahar
arrived, roaring like a tiger for his prey: he called aloud to
revenge their chief, his brother,<a id='r4.26.7' /><a href='#f4.26.7' class='c013'><sup>[7]</sup></a> and fresh vigour was infused
into their souls. On the fall of the mountain-chief, the Chauhan
commanded the ‘hymn of triumph’<a id='r4.26.8' /><a href='#f4.26.8' class='c013'><sup>[8]</sup></a> to be sounded; it startled
the mountaineer, but only to nerve his soul afresh. In person
the Chauhan sought his foe. The son of Somesa is a bridegroom.
His streaming standards flutter like the first falls of rain in Asarh,
and as he steps on the bounds which separate Mandor from
Ajmer, ‘Victory! victory!’ is proclaimed. Still the battle
rages. Elephants roar, horses neigh, terror stalks everywhere.
The aids of Girnar<a id='r4.26.9' /><a href='#f4.26.9' class='c013'><sup>[9]</sup></a> and of Sind now appeared for Mandor,
bearing banners of every colour, varied as the flowers of the
spring. Both arrays were clad in mail; their eyes and their
finger-nails alone were exposed; each invoked his tutelary protector
as he wielded the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>dodhara</em></span>.<a id='r4.26.10' /><a href='#f4.26.10' class='c013'><sup>[10]</sup></a> Prithiraj was refulgent as
Indra; the Parihar’s brightness was as the morning star; each
was clad in armour of proof, immovable as gods in mortal form.
The sword of the Chauhan descended on the steed of the Parihar;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_793'>793</span>but as he fell, Nahar sprung erect, and they again darted on
each other, their warriors forming a fortress around the persons
of their lords. Then advanced the standards of the Pramar,
like a black rolling cloud, while the lightnings flashed from his
sword. Mohana, the brother of Mandor, received him; they
first examined each other—then joining in the strife, the helm
of the Pramar was cleft in twain. Now advanced Chawand, the
Dahima; he grasped his iron lance,<a id='r4.26.11' /><a href='#f4.26.11' class='c013'><sup>[11]</sup></a>—it pierced the Parihar,
and the head appeared like a serpent looking through the door
in his back. The flame (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>jyot</em></span>) united with the fire from which it
sprung, while the body fell on its parent earth. By his devotion
the sins of his life were forgiven. Nobly did the tiger (Nahar)
of Mandor meet the lion of the world. He called aloud, ‘Hold
your ground as did Bal Raja of old.’ Again the battle rages—Durga
gluts herself with blood [684]—the air resounds with the
clash of arms and the rattling of banners—the Aswar<a id='r4.26.12' /><a href='#f4.26.12' class='c013'><sup>[12]</sup></a> rains on
the foe—Khetrpal<a id='r4.26.13' /><a href='#f4.26.13' class='c013'><sup>[13]</sup></a> sports in the field of blood—Mahadeva fills
his necklace—the eagle gluts itself on the slain—the mien of
the warriors expands as does the lotos at the sunbeam—the
war-song resounds—with a branch of the tulasi on the helm,
adorned in the saffron robe, the warriors on either side salute
each other.” The bard here exclaims, “But why should I
enlarge on this encounter?”—but as this digression is merely
for breathing time, we shall not follow him, the object being
to introduce the mountain Mer, whom we now see <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>hors de
combat</em></span>.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Character of the Mers.</h4>—Admitting the exaggeration of the
poet, the Mer appears to have been in the twelfth century what
he is in the nineteenth, a bold, licentious marauder. He maintained
himself throughout the whole of the Mogul domination,
alternately succumbing and depredating; and since the Mahrattas
crippled these countries, the Mer had regained all his consequence,
and was rapidly encroaching upon his Rajput suzerain. But
when in 1821 their excesses made it imperative to reduce their
holds and fastnesses, they made no stand against the three
battalions of sepoys sent against them, and the whole tract was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_794'>794</span>compelled to obedience; not, however, till many of the descendants
of Chita and Barar had suffered both in person and property.<a id='r4.26.14' /><a href='#f4.26.14' class='c013'><sup>[14]</sup></a>
The facility with which we reduced to entire subjection this
extensive association of plunderers, for centuries the terror of
these countries, occasioned no little astonishment to our allies.
The resistance was indeed contemptible, and afforded a good
argument against the prowess of those who had tolerated the
existence of a gang at once so mischievous and weak. But this
was leaping to a conclusion without looking beneath the surface,
or to the moral and political revolution which enervated the arms
of Mer and Mahratta, Pindari and Pathan. All rose to power
from the common occupation of plunderers, aided by the national
jealousies of the Rajputs. If the chieftains of Mewar leagued
to assault the mountaineers, they found refuge and support in
Marwar; and as their fortresses at all times presented a sanctuary,
their Rawats or leaders obtained consequence amongst all parties
by granting it. Every Mer community, accordingly, had a
perfect understanding with the chieftain whose lands were contiguous
to their own, and who enjoyed rights granted by the
Rana over these nominal subjects. These rights were all of a
feudal nature, as <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>rakhwali</em></span> or ‘blackmail’ [685], and those petty
proofs of subordination, entitled in the feudal law of Europe
“petit serjanterie.” The token might be a colt, a hawk, or a
bullock, and a <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>nazarana</em></span>, or pecuniary acknowledgement, perhaps
only of half-a-crown on the chieftain’s birthday, or on the Rajput
Saturnalia, the Holi. But all these petty causes for assimilation
between the Rajput and the lawless Mer were overlooked, as well
as the more powerful one which rendered his arms of no avail.
Every door was hermetically sealed against him; wherever he
looked he saw a foe—the magical change bewildered him; and
when their Khan and his adherents were assailed while in fancied
security, and cut off in a midnight attack, his self-confidence
was annihilated—he saw a red-coat in every glen, and called
aloud for mercy.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Merwāra Battalion.</h4>—A corps of these mountaineers, commanded
by English officers, has since been formed, and I have
no doubt may become useful.<a id='r4.26.15' /><a href='#f4.26.15' class='c013'><sup>[15]</sup></a> Notwithstanding their lawless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_795'>795</span>habits, they did not neglect agriculture and embanking, as
described in the valley of Shera Nala, and a district has been
formed in Merwara which in time may yield a lakh of rupees
annually to the state.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Marriage Customs.</h4>—Some of their customs are so curious,
and so different from those of their lowland neighbours, that we
may mention a few. Leaving their superstitions as regards
omens and auguries, the most singular part of their habits, till
we give a detailed sketch of the Minas hereafter, I will notice
the peculiarity of their notions towards females. The Mer,
following the customary law handed down from his rude ancestry,
and existing long before the written law of Manu, has no objection
to a widow as a wife. This contract is termed <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>nata</em></span>, and his
civilized master levies a fine or fee of a rupee and a quarter for
the licence, termed <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>kagli</em></span>. On such marriage the bridegroom
must omit in the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>maur</em></span>, or nuptial coronet, the graceful palmyra
leaf, and substitute a small branch of the sacred pipal wreathed
in his turban. Many of the forms are according to the common
Hindu ritual. The <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>sat-phera</em></span>, or seven perambulations round
the jars filled with grain, piled over each other—the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>ganth-jora</em></span>, or
uniting the garments—and the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>hathleva</em></span>, or junction of hands of
bride and bridegroom, are followed by the Mers. Even the
northern clans, who are converts to Islam, return to their ancient
habits on this occasion, and have a Brahman priest to officiate.
I discovered, on inquiring into the habits of the Mers, that they
are not the only race which did not refuse to wed a widow, and
that both Brahmans and Rajputs have from ancient times been
accustomed not to consider it derogatory [686].<a id='r4.26.16' /><a href='#f4.26.16' class='c013'><sup>[16]</sup></a> Of the former,
the sacerdotal class, the Nagda<a id='r4.26.17' /><a href='#f4.26.17' class='c013'><sup>[17]</sup></a> Brahmans, established at this
town long before the Guhilots obtained power in Mewar. Of
the Rajputs, they are all of the most ancient tribes, now the
allodial vassals or Bhumias of Rajputana, as the Chinana, Kharwar,
Uten, Daya, names better known in the mystic page of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_796'>796</span>chronicle than now, though occasionally met with in the valleys
of the Aravalli. But this practice, so little known, gives rise to
an opinion, that many of the scrupulous habits regarding women
are the inventions of the priests of more modern days. The
facilities for separation are equally simple. If tempers do not
assimilate, or other causes prompt them to part, the husband
tears a shred from his turban, which he gives to his wife, and
with this simple bill of divorce, placing two jars filled with water
on her head, she takes whatever path she pleases, and the first
man who chooses to ease her of her load becomes her future
lord. This mode of divorce is practised not only amongst all
the Minas, but by Jats, Gujars, Ahirs, Malis, and other Sudra
tribes. <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>Jehar le aur nikali</em></span>, ‘took the jar and went forth,’ is a
common saying amongst the mountaineers of Merwara.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Oaths, Food, Omens.</h4>—Their invocations and imprecations are
peculiar. The Chita or northern Mer, since he became acquainted
with the name of the prophet, swears by ‘Allah,’ or by his first
proselyte ancestor, ‘Duda Dawad Khan,’ or the still more ancient
head of the races, ‘<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>Chita, Barar ka an</em></span>‘. The southern Mers
also use the latter oath: “By my allegiance to Chita and Barar”;
and they likewise swear by the sun, ‘<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>Suraj ka Sagun</em></span>,’ and ‘<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>Nath
ka Sagun</em></span>’; or their ascetic priest, called the Nath. The
Muhammadan Mer will not now eat hog; the southron refuses
nothing, though he respects the cow from the prejudices of those
around him, and to please the Nath or Jogi, his spiritual guide.
The partridge and the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>maloli</em></span>,<a id='r4.26.18' /><a href='#f4.26.18' class='c013'><sup>[18]</sup></a> or wag-tail, are the chief birds of
omen with him, and the former ‘clamouring’ on the left, when
he commences a foray, is a certain presage of success. To conclude;
colonies of the Mers or Meras will be found as far north as
the Chambal, and even in the peninsula of Saurashtra. Merwara
is now in subjection to the Rana of Mewar, who has erected small
forts amidst the most influential communities to overawe them.
The whole tract has been assessed; the chiefs of the districts
being brought to the Rana’s presence presented <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>nazarana</em></span>, swore
fidelity, and received according to their rank gold bracelets or
turbans. It was an era in the annals of Mewar to see the accumulated
arms of Merwara piled upon the [687] terrace of the palace
at the capital; but these measures were subsequent to our sojourn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_797'>797</span>in the glen of Kumbhalmer, from which we have yet to issue to
gain Marwar.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Chief of Gokulgarh.</h4>—<em>October 21.</em>—All hailed the return
of daylight with reverence. Captain Waugh and the Doctor
uncoiled from the elephant’s <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>jhul</em></span>, and I issued from my palki,
which had proved a welcome retreat against the chills of the
night air. By thirst and hunger our appetite for the picturesque
was considerably abated, and the contemplation of the spot
where we had bivouaced in that philosophical spirit of silence,
which all have experienced who have made a long march before
breakfast, lost much of its romantic interest. Nevertheless,
could I have consulted merely my own wishes, I would have
allowed my friends and escort to follow the canteen, and have
pursued an intricate path which branched off to the right, to
have had the chance of an interview with the outlaw of Gokulgarh.</div>

<p class='c001'>This petty chieftain, who enjoyed the distinctive epithet of
outlaw (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>barwatia</em></span>), was of the Sonigira clan (a branch of the
Chauhans), who for centuries were the lords of Jalor. He was
a vassal of Marwar, now sovereign of Jalor, and being expelled
for his turbulence by his prince, he had taken post in the old
ruined castle of Gokulgarh, on a cliff of the Aravalli, and had
become the terror of the country. By his knowledge of the
intricacies of the mountains, he eluded pursuit; and his misdeeds
being not only connived at, but his spoils participated by
the chief of Deogarh, in whose fief was his haunt, he was under
no apprehension of surprise. Inability either to seize the Barwatia,
or drive him from his retreat, formed a legitimate excuse for the
resumption of Gokulgarh, and the dues of ‘blackmail’ he derived
from its twelve dependent villages. The last act of the Sonigira
was most flagrant; he intercepted in the plains of Godwar a
marriage procession, and made captives the bridegroom and
bride, whom he conveyed to Gokulgarh, where they long languished
for want of ransom. A party was formed to lie in wait
for him; but he escaped the snare, and his retreat was found
empty. Such was the state of society in these districts. The
form of outlawry is singular in this country, where the penal
laws are satisfied with banishment, even in cases of treason,
instead of the sanguinary law of civilization. The criminal
against whom the sentence of exile is pronounced being called
into his prince’s presence, is clad in black vestments, and placed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_798'>798</span>upon a black steed, his arms and shield all of the same sombre
hue of mourning and [688] disgrace; he is then left to gain the
frontier by himself. This custom is very ancient: the Pandu
brothers were ‘Barwatias’<a id='r4.26.19' /><a href='#f4.26.19' class='c013'><sup>[19]</sup></a> from the Jumna three thousand years
ago. The Jaisalmer annals relate the solemnity as practised
towards one of their own princes; and the author, in the domestic
dissensions of Kotah, received a letter from the prince, wherein
he demands either that his rights should be conceded, or that
the government would bestow the “black garment,” and leave
him to his fate.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Chief of Ghānērāo.</h4>—Conversing on these and similar
subjects with my Marwari friends, we threaded our way for five
miles through the jungles of the pass, which we had nearly cleared,
when we encountered the chieftain of Ghanerao at the head of
his retinue, who of his own accord, and from a feeling of respect
to his ancient sovereign the Rana, advanced thus far to do me
honour. I felt the compliment infinitely the more, as it displayed
that spirit of loyalty peculiar to the Rajput, though the step was
dangerous with his jealous sovereign, and ultimately was prejudicial
to him. After dismounting and embracing, we continued
to ride to the tents, conversing on the past history of the province,
of his prince, and the Rana, after whom he affectionately inquired.
Ajit Singh is a noble-looking man, about thirty years of age, tall,
fair, and sat his horse like a brave Rathor cavalier. Ghanerao
is the chief town of Godwar, with the exception of the commercial
Pali, and the garrison-post Desuri. From this important district
the Rana could command four thousand Rathors holding lands
on the tenure of service, of whom the Ghanerao chief, then one
of the sixteen nobles of Mewar, was the head. Notwithstanding
the course of events had transferred the province, and consequently
his services, from the Rana of Udaipur to the Raja of
Jodhpur, so difficult is it to eradicate old feelings of loyalty and
attachment, that the present Thakur preferred having the sword
of investiture bound on him by his ancient and yet nominal
suzerain, rather than by his actual sovereign. For this undisguised
mark of feeling, Ghanerao was denuded of its walls,
which were levelled to the ground; a perpetual memento of
disgrace and an incentive to vengeance: and whenever the day
arrives that the Rana’s herald may salute him with the old motto,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_799'>799</span>“Remember Kumbhalmer,” he will not be deaf to the call. To
defend this post was the peculiar duty of his house, and often
have his ancestors bled in maintaining it against the Mogul.
Even now [689], such is the inveteracy with which the Rajput
clings to his honours, that whenever the Ghanerao chief, or any
of his near kin, attend the Rana’s court, he is saluted at the porte,
or at the champ de Mars, by a silver mace-bearer from the Rana,
with the ancient war-cry, “Remember Kumbhalmer,” and he
still receives on all occasions of rejoicing a khilat from that
prince. He has to boast of being of the Rana’s blood, and is
by courtesy called “the nephew of Mewar.” The Thakur
politely invited me to visit him; but I was aware that compliance
would have involved him in difficulties with his jealous prince,
and made excuses of fatigue, and the necessity of marching next
morning, the motives of which he could not misunderstand.</div>

<p class='c001'>Our march this morning was but short, and the last two miles
were in the plains of Marwar, with merely an occasional rock.
Carey joined us, congratulating himself on the ducking which
had secured him better fare than we had enjoyed in the pass of
Kumbhalmer, and which fastened both on Waugh and myself
violent colds. The atmospheric change was most trying: emerging
from the cold breezes of the mountains to 96° of Fahrenheit,
the effect was most injurious: it was 58° in the morning of our
descent into the glen. Alas! for my surviving barometer!
Mahesh, my amanuensis, who had been entrusted with it, joined
us next day, and told me the quicksilver had contrived to escape;
so I lost the opportunity of comparing the level of the desert
with the plains of Marwar.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Chief of Rūpnagar.</h4>—<em>October 27.</em>—Halted to collect the
scattered baggage, and to give the men rest; the day was nearly
over before the whole came up, each party bringing lamentable
reports of the disastrous descent. I received a visit from the
chief of Rupnagar, who, like the Thakur of Ghanerao, owes a
divided allegiance to the courts on each side the mountains.
His castle, which gives him rank as one of the most conspicuous
of the second grade of the Rana’s nobles, was visible from the
camp, being placed on the western face of the mountains, and
commanding a difficult passage across them. From thence he
looks down upon Desuri and his ancient patrimony, now transferred
with Godwar to the Rathor prince; and often has he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_800'>800</span>measured his lance with the present occupants to retain his ancient
<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>bhum</em></span>, the right derived from the cultivating proprietor of the
soil. The chief of Rupnagar is of the Solanki race, a lineal
descendant of the sovereigns of Nahrwala, and the inheritor [690]
of the war-shell of the celebrated monarch Siddhraj,<a id='r4.26.20' /><a href='#f4.26.20' class='c013'><sup>[20]</sup></a> one of the
most powerful who ever sat on an eastern throne, and who occupied
that of Anhilwara from <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1094, during half a century, celebrated
as a patron of literature and the arts. When in the
thirteenth century this State was destroyed, the branches found
refuge, as already described, in Mewar; for the ancestor of
Rupnagar was brother to the father of “the star of Badnor,”
and was invested with the estate and lands of Desuri by the same
gallant prince who obtained her hand by the recovery of her
father’s estates. The anecdote is worthy of relation, as showing
that the Rajput will stop at nothing “to obtain land.” The
intestine feuds amongst Rana Raemall’s sons, and his constant
warfare with the kings of Delhi and Malwa, made his authority
very uncertain in Godwar. The Mina and Mer possessed themselves
of lands in the plains, and were supported by the Madrecha
descendant of the once independent Chauhan sovereigns of Nadol,
the ancient capital of this region. Sand, the Madrecha, had
obtained possession of Desuri, the garrison town. To expel him,
the prince had recourse to Sada, the Solanki, whose son was
married to the daughter of the Madrecha. The bribe for the
reward of this treachery was to be the grant in perpetuity of
Desuri and its lands. Sada’s son readily entered into the scheme;
and to afford facilities for its execution he went with his wife
to reside at Desuri. It was long before an opportunity offered;
but at length the marriage of the young Madrecha to the daughter
of Sagra the Balecha was communicated to the Solanki by his
son; who told his father “to watch the smoke ascending from
the tower of Desuri,” as the signal for the attempt to get possession.
Anxiously did Sand watch from his castle of Sodhgarh
the preconcerted sign, and when the volume of black smoke
ascended, he rushed down from the Aravalli at the head of his
retainers. The mother-in-law of the young Solanki sent to know
why he should make a smoke as if he were burning a corpse,
when her son must be returning with his bride. Soon she heard
the clash of arms; the Solankis had entered and fired the town,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_801'>801</span>and the bridal party appeared before success was attained. Spears
and swords were plied. “’Ware the bull!” (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>sand</em></span>), said the
Madrecha, as he encountered his foe. “My name is the lion
(<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>singh</em></span>) who will [691] devour the bull,” replied the Solanki.
The contest was fierce, but the Madrechas were slain, and in the
morn Prithiraj was put in possession of Desuri. He drew out a
grant upon the spot, inserting in it a curse against any of Sesodia
blood who might break the bond which had restored the Rathor
authority in Godwar. Although seventeen generations have
passed since this event, the feud has continued between the
descendants of the lion of Sodhgarh and the bull of Desuri, though
the object of dissension is alienated from both.</div>

<p class='c001'><b>The Chief of Ghānērāo. The Rājputs of Mewār and Mārwār
compared.</b>—I could well have dispensed with visits this day, the
thermometer being 96°; I was besides devoured with inflammatory
cold; but there was no declining another polite visit
of the chieftain of Ghanerao. His retinue afforded a good opportunity
of contrasting the Sesodia Rajput of fertile Mewar with
the Rathors of Marwar, and which on the whole would have been
favourable to the latter, if we confined our view to those of the
valley of Udaipur, or the mountainous region of its southern limit,
where climate and situation are decidedly unfavourable. There
the Rajput may be said not only to deteriorate in muscular form
and strength, but in that fairness of complexion which distinguishes
him from the lower orders of Hindus. But the danger
of generalizing on such matters will be apparent when it is known
that there is a cause continually operating to check and diminish
the deteriorating principle arising from the climate and situation
(or, as the Rajput would say, from the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>hawa pani</em></span>, ‘air and
water’) of these unhealthy tracts; namely, the continual influx
of the purest blood from every region in Rajputana: and the
stream which would become corrupt if only flowing from the
commingling of the Chondawats of Salumbar and the Jhalas of
Gogunda (both mountainous districts), is refreshed by that of
the Rathors of Godwar, the Chauhans of Haraoti, or the Bhatti
of the desert. I speak from conviction, the chieftains above
mentioned affording proofs of the evil resulting from such repeated
intermarriages; for, to use their own adage, “a raven will produce
a raven.” But though the personal appearance of the
chieftain of Gogunda might exclude him from the table of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_802'>802</span>sixteen barons of Mewar, his son by a Rathor mother may be
exhibited as a redeeming specimen of the Jhalas, and one in every
way favourable of the Rajput of Mewar. On such occasion,
also, as a formal visit, both chieftain and retainers appear under
every advantage of dress and decoration; for even the form of
the turban may improve the contour of the face, though [692]
the Mertias of Ghanerao have nothing so decidedly peculiar in
this way as those of other clans.</p>

<p class='c001'>After some discourse on the history of past days, with which,
like every respectable Rajput, I found him perfectly conversant,
the Ghanerao chief took his leave with some courteous and
friendly expressions. It is after such a conversation that the
mind disposed to reflection will do justice to the intelligence of
these people: I do not say this with reference to the baron of
Ghanerao, but taking them generally. If by history we mean
the relation of events in succession, with an account of the leading
incidents connecting them, then are all the Rajputs versed in
this science; for nothing is more common than to hear them
detail their immediate ancestry or that of their prince for many
generations, with the events which have marked their societies.
It is immaterial whether he derives this knowledge from the
chronicle, the chronicler, or both: it not only rescues him from
the charge of ignorance, but suggests a comparison between him
and those who constitute themselves judges of nationalities by
no means unfavourable to the Rajput.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Godwār.</h4>—<em>October 28.</em>—Marched at daybreak. The Thakur
sent a confidential vassal to accompany me through his domain.
We could now look around us, as we receded from the Alpine
Aravalli, with nothing to obstruct the vision, over the fertile
plains of Godwar. We passed near Ghanerao, whose isolated
portals, without tower or curtain to connect them, have a most
humiliating appearance. It is to Raja Bhim, some twenty years
ago, that their chieftains owe this degradation, in order to lessen
their ability to recover the province for its ancient master the
Rana. It was indeed one of the gems of his crown, as it is the
only dazzling one in that of Marwar. While we marched over
its rich and beautiful plains, well watered, well wooded, and
abounding in fine towns, I entered into conversation with the
Rana’s envoy, who joined me on the march. Kishandas has
already been mentioned as one of the few men of integrity and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_803'>803</span>wisdom who had been spared to be useful to his country. He
was a mine of ancient lore, and his years, his situation, and his
character gave force to his sentiments of determined independence.
He was as quick as touchwood, which propensity occasionally
created a wordy war between me and my friend, who knew
my respect for him. “Restore us Godwar,” was his abrupt
salutation as he joined me on the march: to which, being a little
vexed, as the point could not be agitated by our government, I
said in reply, “Why did you [693] let them take it?—where has
the Sesodia sword slept this half century?” Adding, “God
Almighty never intended that the region on this side the mountains
should belong to Mewar;—nature’s own hand has placed
the limit between you.” The old envoy’s blood was roused as
he exclaimed, “Even on this principle Godwar is ours, for
nature has marked our limit by stronger features than mountains.
Observe, as you advance, and you will find to the further limit
of the province every shrub and flower common to Mewar; pass
that limit but a few yards, and they are lost:</div>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_804'>804</span>into a summary analysis of the cause why the couplet of the
bard should be deemed “confirmation strong” of the bounds of
kingdoms. These traditionary couplets, handed down from
generation to generation, are the most powerful evidence of the
past, and they are accordingly employed to illustrate the Khyats,
or annals, of Rajputana. When, towards the conclusion of the
fourteenth century, the founder of the Chondawats repaid the
meditated treachery of Ranmall of Mandor by his death, he took
possession of that capital and the entire country of the Rathors
(then but of small extent), which he held for several years. The
heir of Mandor became a fugitive, concealing himself in the fastnesses
of the Aravalli, with little hope that [694] his name (Jodha)
would become a patronymic, and that he would be honoured as
the second founder of his country: that Mandor itself should be
lost in Jodhpur. The recollection of the feud was almost extinct;
the young Rana of Chitor had passed the years of Rajput minority,
and Jodha continued a fugitive in the wilds of Bhandak-parao,
with but a few horse in his train, indebted to the resources of
some independents of the desert for the means of subsistence.
He was discovered in this retreat by a Charan or bard, who,
without aspiring to prophetic powers, revealed to him that the
intercession of the queen-mother of Chitor had determined the
Rana to restore him to Mandor. Whether the sister of Jodha,
to give éclat to the restoration, wished it to have the appearance
of a conquest, or whether Jodha, impatient for possession, took
advantage of circumstances to make his entrance one of triumph,
and thereby redeem the disgrace of a long and humiliating exile,
it is difficult to decide; for while the annals of Mewar make the
restoration an act of grace, those of Marwar give it all the colours
of a triumph. Were the point worthy of discussion, we should
say both accounts were correct. The Rana had transmitted the
recall of Chonda from Mandor, but concealed from him the
motive, and while Jodha even held in his possession the Rana’s
letter of restoration, a concatenation of circumstances, in which
“the omen” was predominant, occurred to make him anticipate
his induction by a measure more consonant to the Rajput, a
brilliant <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>coup de main</em></span>. Jodha had left his retreat in the Run<a id='r4.26.34' /><a href='#f4.26.34' class='c013'><sup>[34]</sup></a>
to make known to Harbuji Sankhla, Pabuji, and other rievers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_805'>805</span>of the desert, the changes which the bard had communicated.
While he was there, intelligence was brought that Chonda, in
obedience to his sovereign’s command, had proceeded to Chitor.
That same night “the bird of omen perched on Jodha’s lance,
and the star which irradiated his birth shone bright upon it.”
The bard of Mandor revealed the secret of heaven to Jodha, and
the heroes in his train: “Ere that star descends in the west,
your pennon will wave on the battlements of Mandor.” Unless,
however, this “vision of glory” was merely mental, Jodha’s
star must have been visible in daylight; for they could never
have marched from the banks of the Luni, where the Sankhla
resided, to Mandor, between its rising and setting. The elder son
of Chonda had accompanied his father, and they had proceeded
two coss in their [695] journey, when a sudden blaze appeared in
Mandor: Chonda pursued his route, while his son Manja returned
to Mandor. Jodha was already in possession; his <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>an</em></span> had been
proclaimed, and the two other sons of Chonda had fallen in its
defence. Manja, who fled, was overtaken and slain on the
border. These tidings reached Chonda at the pass of the Aravalli;
he instantly returned to Mandor, where he was met by Jodha,
who showed him the letters of surrender for Mandor, and a command
that he should fix with him the future boundary of each
State. Chonda thought that there was no surer line of demarcation
than that chalked out by the hand of nature; and he accordingly
fixed that wherever the “yellow blossom” was found, the
land should belong to his sovereign, and the bard was not slow in
perpetuating the decree. Such is the origin of</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>The brave and loyal founder of the Chondawats, who thus
sacrificed his revenge to his sovereign’s commands, had his
feelings in some degree propitiated by this arrangement, which
secured the entire province of Godwar to his prince: his son
Manja fell, as he touched the region of the anwalas, and this cession
may have been in ‘<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>mundkati</em></span>,’ the compromise of the price of
blood. By such traditional legends, not less true than strange,
and to which the rock sculptures taken from Mandor bear evidence,
even to the heroes who aided Jodha in his enterprise, the anwal
of the Rajputs has been immortalized, like the humble broom of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_806'>806</span>the French, whose planta-genesta has distinguished the loftiest
name in chivalry, the proudest race emblazoned on the page of
heraldry.</p>

<p class='c001'>Notwithstanding the crops had been gathered, this tract contrasted
favourably with Mewar, although amidst a comparative
prosperity we could observe the traces of rapine; and numerous
stories were rehearsed of the miseries inflicted on the people by
the rapacious followers of Amir Khan. We crossed numerous
small streams flowing from the Aravalli, all proceeding to join
the “Salt River,” or Luni. The villages were large and more
populous; yet was there a dulness, a want of that hilarity which
pervaded the peasantry of Mewar, in spite of their misfortunes.
The Rajputs partook of the feeling, the cause of which a little
better acquaintance with their headquarters soon revealed.
Mewar had passed through the period [696] of reaction, which in
Marwar was about to display itself, and was left unfortunately
to its own control, or with only the impulse of a long suppressed
feeling of revenge in the bosom of its prince, and the wiles of a
miscreant minister, who wished to keep him in durance, and the
country in degradation.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Nādol.</h4>—It creates a refreshing sensation to find the camp
pitched in a cool and shaded spot; and at Nadol<a id='r4.26.35' /><a href='#f4.26.35' class='c013'><sup>[35]</sup></a> we had this
satisfaction. Here again there was no time for recreation, for
there was abundant, nay, overwhelming matter both for the pen
and the pencil; but my readers must be satisfied with the imperfect
delineations of the first. Nadol is still a place of some
consequence, though, but for its temples, we should not have
supposed it to have been the capital of a province. With its
neighbour, Narlai, five miles to the westward, it was the abode
of a branch of the Chauhans of Ajmer, established at a very early
period. From Nadol sprung the Deoras of Sirohi, and the
Sonigiras of Jalor. The former still maintain their ground, in
spite of all attempts of the Rathors; but the Sonigira, who was
immortalized by his struggle against the second Ala, is blotted
from the list of independent States; and this valuable domain,
consisting of three hundred and sixty towns, is now incorporated
with Jodhpur.</div>

<p class='c001'>There is no spot in Rajputana that does not contain some
record of the illustrious Chauhan; and though every race has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_807'>807</span>had its career of glory, the sublimity of which, the annals of the
Sesodias before the reader sufficiently attest, yet with all my
partiality for those with whom I long resided, and with whose
history I am best acquainted, my sense of justice compels me to
assign the palm of martial intrepidity to the Chauhan over all
the “royal races” of India. Even the bards, to whatever family
they belong, appear to articulate the very name as if imbued with
some peculiar energy, and dwell on its terminating nasal with
peculiar complacency. Although they had always ranked high
in the list of chivalry, yet the seal of the order was stamped on
all who have the name of Chauhan, since the days of Prithiraj,
the model of every Rajput, and who had a long line of fame to
maintain. Of the many names familiar to the bard is Guga of
Bhatinda, who with forty-seven sons “drank of the stream of
the sword” on the banks of the Sutlej, in opposing Mahmud.<a id='r4.26.36' /><a href='#f4.26.36' class='c013'><sup>[36]</sup></a>
This conqueror proceeded through the desert to the attack of
Ajmer, the chief abode of this race, where his arms were disgraced,
the invader wounded, and forced to relinquish his enterprise [697].
In his route to Nahrwala and Somnath he passed Nadol,<a id='r4.26.37' /><a href='#f4.26.37' class='c013'><sup>[37]</sup></a> whose
prince hesitated not to measure his sword even with Mahmud.
I was fortunate enough to obtain an inscription regarding this
prince, the celebrated Lakha, said to be the founder of this
branch from Ajmer, of which it was a fief—its date S. 1039
(<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 983).<a id='r4.26.38' /><a href='#f4.26.38' class='c013'><sup>[38]</sup></a> The fortress attributed to Lakha is on the declivity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_808'>808</span>of a low ridge to the westward of the town, with square towers
of ancient form, and built of a very curious conglomerate of
granite and gneiss, of which the rock on which it stands is composed.
There was a second inscription, dated S. 1024 (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 968),
which made him the contemporary of the Rana’s ancestor,
Sakti Kumar of Aitpur, a city also destroyed, more probably
by the father of Mahmud. The Chauhan bards speak in very
lofty terms of Rao Lakha, who “collected transit dues from the
further gate of Anhilwara, and levied tribute from the prince
of Chitor.”</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Remains at Nādol.</h4>—It is impossible to do full justice to the
architectural remains, which are well worthy of the pencil. Here
everything shows that the Jain faith was once predominant,
and that their arts, like their religion, were of a character quite
distinct from those of Siva. The temple of Mahavira, the
last of their twenty-four apostles, is a very fine piece of
architecture. Its vaulted roof is a perfect model of the most
ancient style of dome in the East; probably invented anterior
to the Roman. The principle is no doubt the same as the
first substitute of the arch, and is that which marked the genius
of Caesar in his bridge over the Rhone, and which appears
over every mountain torrent of the ancient Helvetii, from
whom he may have borrowed it.<a id='r4.26.39' /><a href='#f4.26.39' class='c013'><sup>[39]</sup></a> The principle is that of a
horizontal instead of a radiating pressure. At Nadol the stones
are placed by a gradual projection one over the other, the
apex being closed by a circular key-stone. The angles of
all these projections being rounded off, the spectator looking
up can only describe the vault as a series of gradually diminishing
amulets or rings converging to the apex. The effect is
very pleasing, though it furnishes a strong argument that the
Hindus first became acquainted with the perfect arch through
their conquerors. The <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>toran</em></span>, in front of the altar of Mahavira,
is exquisitely sculptured, as well as several statues of marble,
discovered about one hundred and fifty years ago in the bed of
the river, when it changed its course. It is not unlikely that
they were buried during Mahmud’s invasion. But [698] the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_809'>809</span>most singular structure of Nadol is a reservoir, called the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>chana
ki baoli</em></span>, from the cost of it being paid by the return of a single
grain of pulse (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>chana</em></span>). The excavation is immense; the descent
is by a flight of grey granite steps, and the sides are built up from
the same materials by piling blocks upon blocks of enormous
magnitude, without the least cement.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Inscriptions and Coins.</h4>—My acquisitions here were considerable.
Besides copies of inscriptions made by my Sanskrit scribes,
I obtained two originals on brass. Of one of these, dated S. 1218,
the memorial of Alandeva, I append a translation,<a id='r4.26.40' /><a href='#f4.26.40' class='c013'><sup>[40]</sup></a> which may
be considered curious as a formula of endowment of the Jains.
I likewise procured several isolated MS. leaves of very great
value, relative to the thirty-six royal races, to the ancient geography
of India, and to the founding of ancient cities; also a
catalogue of longevity of plants and animals, and an extract
from a work concerning the descendants of Srenika and Samprati,
the potent princes of the Jain faith between Mahavira and
Vikrama. However meagre these fragments may be, I have
incorporated their contents into my mosaic. I also made valuable
additions to my collection of medals, for I obtained coins of
Mahmud, Balban, and Ala, surnamed Khuni, or ‘the sanguinary’;
and another of a conqueror equally meriting that title, Nadir
Shah. But these were of little consequence compared with what
one of my envoys brought from Narlai—a small bag full of
curious hieroglyphical (if I may so use the term) medals of the
Chauhan princes.<a id='r4.26.41' /><a href='#f4.26.41' class='c013'><sup>[41]</sup></a> One side represents a warrior on horseback,
compounded out of a character to which I have applied the above
term; on some there was a bull; while others, retaining the
original reverse, have on the obverse the titles of the first Islamite
conquerors, in the same manner as the currency of France bears
the effigies of Louis XVI. and the emblems of the Republic.
Whoever will pay a visit to Nadol will find his labour amply
rewarded; I had only leisure to glean a few of these relics, which
yet formed a rich harvest. Narlai, Bali, Desuri, Sadri, all
ancient seats of the Jains, will yield medals, MSS., and rare
specimens of the architectural art. From Abu to Mandor, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_810'>810</span>antiquary might fill many portfolios, and collect matter for
volumes of the ancient history of this people, for this is the cradle
of their faith. That I was enabled to obtain so much during a
rapid march through the country arose partly from previous
[699] knowledge, partly from the extent of my means, for I had
flying detachments to the right and left of my route, consisting
of intelligent natives of each city, accompanied by pandits for
deciphering, and others for collecting whatever was the object of
research; who, at the close of each day, brought me the fruits
of their inquiries. When any remarkable discovery was made,
I followed it up in person, or by sending those in whom I could
confide. This is not mentioned from a spirit of egotism, but to
incite others to the pursuit by showing the rewards which await
such research.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Indara.</h4>—<em>October 29.</em>—Camp at Indara, eleven miles. This
small town, placed on the north bank of one of the nameless
feeders of the ‘salt river,’ is the boundary of Godwar; here the
reign of the yellow anwal terminates, and here commences Marusthali,
or ‘the region of death.’ The transition is great. We can
look back upon fertility, and forward on aridity, which does not,
however, imply sterility: for that cunning artist, nature, compensates
the want of verdure and foliage to the inhabitants of the
desert by many spontaneous bounties. An entire race of cucurbitaceous
plants is the eleemosynary equivalent for the mango and
exotics of the central lands of Rajputana; while indigenous
poverty sends forth her commercial sons from Osi, Pali, and
Pokaran, to bring wealth from the Ganges and the Kistna, to the
Luni, or to the still more remote oasis, Jaisalmer. From Indara
everything assumed a new character: the sand, of which we had
before scarcely a sprinkling, became occasionally heavy; the
shallow beds of the numerous streams were white with saline
incrustations; and the vegetable creation had been gradually
diminishing, from the giant race of the sacred fig-tree with leaf
“broad as Amazonian targe,” to the dwarfish shrubs of the
desert. At once the satiric stanza of the bard of a more favoured
region was brought to my mind, and as I repeated it to my old
friend the Rana’s envoy, he enjoyed the confession, and afresh
urged his wish that nature should decide the question of their
boundaries:</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Construction of Villages.</h4>—The villages are of a construction
totally distinct from anything we have seen, and more approaching
the wigwam of the western world. Every commune is
surrounded with a circumvallation of thorns, <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>kanta ka kot</em></span>, and
the stacks of <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>bhus</em></span>, or ‘chaff,’ which are placed at intervals, give
it the appearance of a respectable fortification. These <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>bhus</em></span>
stacks are erected to provide provender for the cattle in scanty
rainy seasons, when the parched earth denies grass, or full crops
of maize. They are erected to the height of twenty or thirty
feet, coated with a cement of earth and cow-dung, and with a
sprinkling of thorns, to prevent the fowls of the air from reposing
in them. In this manner, with a little fresh coating, they will
exist ten years, being only resorted to on emergencies, when the
kine may be said to devour the village walls. Their appearance
is a great relief to the monotony of the march through the desert;
which, however, cannot strictly be said to commence till you
cross the Luni.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Pāli.</h4>—<em>October 30.</em>—A long march of twenty-one miles, in which
there was little to record, brought us to Pali, the great commercial
mart of western Rajwara. Like everything else in these regions
it bore the marks of rapine; and as in the civil wars of this State
its possession was of great importance to either party, the fortifications
were razed at the desire of the inhabitants, who did not
admire the noise of war within their gates. From the same
feeling, when it was proposed to gird the sister mart, Bhilwara,
with walls, the opposition to it was universal. The remnants of
the walls lend it an air of desolation.<a id='r4.26.42' /><a href='#f4.26.42' class='c013'><sup>[42]</sup></a> The town is overrated at
ten thousand houses. As an emporium its reputation is of ancient
<span class='pageno' id='Page_812'>812</span>date: and, politically, it is connected with the establishment of
the reigning family in these regions. A community of Brahmans
then held Pali in grant from the princes of Mandor: whence comes
a numerous class, termed Paliwal, who follow mercantile pursuits.
It was in S. 1212 (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1156) that Siahji, the founder of the Rathor
dynasty and son to the emperor of Kanauj, passed Pali on his
return from a pilgrimage from Dwarka to the Ganges. The
Brahmans sent a deputation to relieve them from two great
enemies to their repose, namely, the Minas of the Aravalli, and
the lions, which had become very numerous. Siahji relieved
them from both; but the opportunity “to acquire land” was
too good to be lost, and on the festival of the Holi he put the
leading Brahmans to death, and took possession of Pali.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Commerce of Pāli.</h4>—Commerce, in these regions, is the
basis of liberty: even despotism is [701] compelled to leave it
unrestrained. Pali, like Bhilwara, Jhalrapatan, Rani, and other
marts, enjoys the right of electing its own magistrates, both for
its municipal regulations, and the arbitration of all matters connected
with commercial pursuits. It was commerce which freed
Europe from the bondage of feudality; and the towns above
cited only require the same happy geographical position, to play
the part of the Hanse towns of Europe. Like Bhilwara, Pali has
its own currency, which, amidst universal deterioration, it has
retained undebased. From remote times, Pali has been the
connecting link between the sea-coast and northern India. Commercial
houses established at Muskat-Mandavi, Surat, and
Navanagar transmit the products of Persia, Arabia, Africa, and
Europe, receiving those of India and Thibet. To enumerate all
the articles, it would be necessary to name the various products
of each: from the coast, elephants’ teeth, rhinoceros’ hides,
copper, tin, pewter, dates dried and moist,<a id='r4.26.43' /><a href='#f4.26.43' class='c013'><sup>[43]</sup></a> of which there is an
immense consumption in these regions; gum-arabic, borax, coco-nuts,
broad-cloths, striped silks, called <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>patang</em></span>; various dyes,
particularly the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>kermes</em></span> or crimson; drugs, especially the oxides
of arsenic and quicksilver; spices, sandal-wood, camphor, tea,
<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>momiai</em></span> or mummy,<a id='r4.26.44' /><a href='#f4.26.44' class='c013'><sup>[44]</sup></a> which is much sought after in medicine, and

<p class='c001'>The exports of home production are the two staple articles

and paper made in the town of Pali. The <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>lois</em></span>, or blankets, are
disseminated throughout India, and may be had at from four
to sixty rupees per pair; scarfs and turbans are made of the same
material, but not for exportation. But salt is the chief article
of export, and the duties arising therefrom equal half the land
revenue of the country. Of the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>agars</em></span>, or ‘salt lakes,’ Pachbhadra,
Phalodi, and Didwana are the principal, the first being several

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Chāran and Bhāt Carriers.</h4>—The Charans and Bhats, or bards
and genealogists, are the chief carriers of these regions: their
sacred character overawes the lawless Rajput chief; and even
the savage Koli and Bhil, and the plundering Sahariya of the
desert, dread the anathema of these singular races, who conduct
the caravans through the wildest and most desolate regions.

ancient and numerous sect exists, magical skill is always asserted.

the Luni. There was nothing to arrest attention between Pali
and the Luni: all is flat and lonely in the thirty miles which
intervene. Our halts were at Kairla, which has two small salt
lakes, whence its name; in fact, this superabundant product,
<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>khar</em></span>, or salt, gives its name to streams and towns. Both Kairla
and Rohat, the intermediate places of halt, are feudal estates,
and both chiefs had been involved in the recent civil dissensions:
Rohat was under the ban.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Bhāt Customs. Coercion by Threat of Human Sacrifice.</h4>—Here
I had an exemplification of the vulgar adage, “two of a trade,”
etc. Pema Naik, the leader of one of the largest <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>tandas</em></span>, or
caravans, which frequent the desert for salt, had left his convoy,
and with his brethren came to exhibit his wounds and fractures
received in a fray with the leaders of another caravan. Both
were Bhats; Pema was the head of the Bamania Bhats, so called
from the place of their abode, and he counted forty thousand
beasts of burthen under his control. Shama had no distinctive
epithet: he had no home separate from [703] his <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>tanda</em></span>. His
little State when not in motion was on the highways; hence those
who dwell entirely with their cattle are styled <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>upapanti</em></span>, ‘on the
road.’ Shama had taken advantage of the greater portion of
Pema’s caravan being detached to revenge an ancient feud;
and had shown himself quite an adept in club-law, as the broken
heads of his opponents disclosed. To reconcile them was impossible;
and as the case was to be decided, not by the scales
of abstract justice but by calculating which contributed most in
duties, Pema by this summary process, more than from sympathy
to his wounded honour, gained a victory by the exclusion of his
rival. As before observed, these classes take advantage of their
sacred character amongst the Rajputs to become the general
<span class='pageno' id='Page_815'>815</span>carriers of the country: but the advantage which might result
to the State from the respect paid to them is neutralized by their
avarice and constant evasion of the payment of all established
duties. A memorable example of this kind occurred during the
reign of Amra the First with the ancestor of this same Pema.
The Rana would not submit to the insolent demands of the Bhats,
when they had recourse to one of the most sanguinary sacrifices
ever recorded—the threat alone of which is generally sufficient
to extort acquiescence and concession. But the firmness of Amra
has been recorded: and he braved them. Collecting the elder
portion of their community, men, women, and youths of both
sexes, they made a sacrifice to the number of eighty souls with
their daggers in the court of the palace. The blood of the victims
was on the Rana’s head.<a id='r4.26.49' /><a href='#f4.26.49' class='c013'><sup>[49]</sup></a> It was a species of excommunication,
which would have unsettled a weaker reason; for the Rajput
might repose after the murder of a Brahman, but that of the
prophetic Vates would rise against him here and hereafter. For
once they encountered a mind too strong to be shaken; Amra
banished the whole fraternity of Bamania Bhats from his
dominions, and the town of Bamani reverted to the fisc. The
edict remained uncancelled until these days, when amongst the
industrious of all classes whom the proclamations<a id='r4.26.50' /><a href='#f4.26.50' class='c013'><sup>[50]</sup></a> brought once
more to Mewar, came Pema and his brethren. Although tradition
had preserved the causes of their exile, it had made no alteration
in their sentiments and opinions, and the dagger was always
at hand, to be sheathed in their own flesh whenever provocation
called it from the girdle. Pema beset the Rana in all his rides,
demanding a reduction [704] or rather abolition of duties for his
<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>tanda</em></span>; and at length he took up a position on the terrace fronting
the ‘balcony of the sun,’ threatening a <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>chandni</em></span>,<a id='r4.26.51' /><a href='#f4.26.51' class='c013'><sup>[51]</sup></a> for such is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_816'>816</span>term applied to this suicidal revenge. The Rana, who had not
the nerve of his ancestor, sent to me to beseech my interference:
with his messenger, one from me returned to invite the Bhats to
a settlement. They came, as fine, robust, intrepid a set as I
ever saw. We soon came to issue: I urged that duties must be
paid by all who chose to frequent the passes of Mewar, and that
they would get nothing by their present silly mode of endeavouring
to obtain remission; that if they would give a written agreement
to abide by the scale of duties laid down, they should receive
exemption for five hundred out of the forty thousand bullocks
of their <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>tanda</em></span>, and be reinducted into Bamani; if not, there were
daggers (showing them some on the table), and they might begin
as soon as they pleased. I added that, in addition to Rana
Amra’s penalty of banishment, I would recommend confiscation
of their entire caravan. Pema was no fool: he accepted Bamani,
and the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>muafi</em></span> for five hundred, and that day received his
gold bracelets and clothes of investiture for Bamani from the
Rana.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Jhālamand.</h4>—<em>November 2.</em>—Jhalamand, ten miles. Although
within one march of Jodhpur, we were obliged to make an intermediate
halt, in order to arrange the ceremonials of reception;
a grave matter with all the magnates of the East, who regulate
all such affairs by slavish precedent and ancestral wisdom. On
such a novel occasion as the reception of an English envoy at
this desert court, they were a good deal puzzled how to act. They
could very well comprehend how an ambassador direct from
majesty should be received, and were not unfamiliar with the
formula to be observed towards a viceregal legation. But the
present case was an anomaly: the Governor of all India, of course,
could appear only as the first servant of a commercial body,
which, with whatever privileges invested, never could be made to
rank with royalty or its immediate emanation. Accordingly, this
always proved a clog to our diplomatic missions, until the diffusion
of our power from the Indus to the ocean set speculation at rest
on the formalities of reception of the Company’s ambassadors.
On the other hand, the eternal rotation of military adventurers
enjoying ephemeral power, such as the commanders of the myrmidons
of Sindhia and Holkar, compelled all the Rajput princes
to forgo much of their dignity; and men like Amir Khan, Jean
Baptiste, or Bapu Sindhia, who but a [705] short time ago would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_817'>817</span>have deemed themselves honoured with a seat in the ante-chamber,
claimed equality of reception with princes. Each made it a
subject for boasting, how far he had honoured himself by the
humiliation of the descendant of the emperor of Kanauj, or the
scion of Rama. At the same time, as the world is always deceived
by externals, it was difficult to concede a reception less distinguished
than that granted to the leader of a Mahratta horde;
and here their darling precedent was available. To what distance
did the Raja send the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>istikbal</em></span> to meet Amir Khan? what was the
rank of the chieftains so deputed? and to what point did the
“offspring of the sun” condescend to advance in person to
receive this “lord of the period”? All these, and many similar
questions, were propounded through the Wakil, who had long
been with me, to his sovereign, to whose presence he proceeded
in order that they might be adjusted, while I halted at Jhalamand,
only five miles from the capital. However individually we may
despise these matters, we have no option, as public servants, but
to demand the full measure of honour for those we represent.
As the present would also regulate future receptions, I was compelled
to urge that the Raja would best consult his own dignity
by attending to that of the government I represented, and distinctly
signified that it could never be tolerated that he should
descend to the very foot of his castle to honour Amir Khan, and
await the English envoy almost on the threshold of his palace.
It ended, as such matters generally do in those countries, by a
compromise: it was stipulated that the Raja should receive the
mission in his <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>palki</em></span> or litter, at the central barrier of descent.<a id='r4.26.52' /><a href='#f4.26.52' class='c013'><sup>[52]</sup></a>
These preliminaries being arranged, we left Jhalamand in the
afternoon, that we might not derange the habits of slumber of
those who were to conduct us to the capital. About half-way
we were met by the great feudatory chieftains of Pokaran and
Nimaj, then lords of the ascendant, and the joint advisers of their
sovereign. We dismounted, embraced, complimented each other
in the customary phraseology; then remounted, and rode together
until we reached the tents, where, after I had requested them to
be the bearers of my homage to their sovereign, we mutually
saluted and parted.</div>

<div class='section-start'><span class='pageno' id='Page_818'>818</span><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Chief of Pokaran.</h4>—Salim Singh<a id='r4.26.53' /><a href='#f4.26.53' class='c013'><sup>[53]</sup></a> was the name of the lord
of Pokaran, the most wealthy and the [706] most powerful of
all the baronies of Marwar. His castle and estate (wrested from
Jaisalmer) are in the very heart of the desert; the former is
strong both by position and art. It is a family which has often
shaken the foundation of the throne of Marwar. During four
generations have its bold and turbulent chiefs made the most
resolute of these monarchs tremble. Deo Singh, the great grandfather
of the present chief, used to sleep in the hall of the royal
palace, with five hundred of his Champawats, of which clan he
is the chief. “The throne of Marwar is within the sheath of
my dagger,” was the boast, as elsewhere mentioned, of this
haughty noble to his sovereign. His son, Sabal Singh, followed
his father’s steps, and even dethroned the great Bijai Singh: a
cannon-shot relieved the prince from this terror of his reign.
Sawai Singh, his son and successor, acted the same part towards
Raja Bhim, and was involved in the civil wars which commenced
in 1806, when he set up the pretender, Dhonkal Singh. The
catastrophe of Nagor, in which Amir Khan acted the assassin of
the Champawat and all his associates, relieved Raja Man from
the evil genius of his house; and the honours this prince heaped
on the son of the Champawat, in giving him the first office in
the State, were but a trap to ensnare him. From this he escaped,
or his life and the honours of Pokaran would have been
lost together. Such is a rapid sketch of the family of the
chief who was deputed to meet me. He was about thirty-five
years of age; his appearance, though not prepossessing, was
dignified and commanding. In person he was tall, but more
powerful than athletic; his features were good, but his complexion
was darker than in general amongst the chieftains of
Marwar.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Chief of Nīmāj.</h4>—His companion, and associate in the
councils of his prince, was in every point of personal appearance
the reverse of this portrait. Surthan Singh was chief of the
Udawats, a clan which can muster four thousand swords, all
residing on the land skirting the Aravalli; and of which his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_819'>819</span>residence Nimaj,<a id='r4.26.54' /><a href='#f4.26.54' class='c013'><sup>[54]</sup></a> Raepur, and Chandawal are the principal fiefs.
Surthan was a fine specimen of the Rajput; his figure tall and
graceful; his complexion fair; his deportment manly and mild;
in short, he was a thorough gentleman in appearance, understanding,
and manners.</div>

<p class='c001'>It would be impossible to relate here all the causes which
involved him in the catastrophe from which his coadjutor escaped.
It was the misfortune of Surthan to have been associated with
Salim Singh; but his past services to his prince amply counterbalanced
this party bias. It was he who prevented his sovereign
from [707] sheathing a dagger in his heart on the disgraceful day
at Parbatsar; and he was one of the four chieftains of all Marwar
who adhered to his fortunes when beset by the united force of
Rajputana. He was also one of the same four who redeemed

mourning into every house of Rajasthan.<a id='r4.26.55' /><a href='#f4.26.55' class='c013'><sup>[55]</sup></a> The death of Surthan
Singh was a prodigal sacrifice, and caused a sensation of universal
sorrow, in which I unfeignedly participated. His gallant bearing
was the theme of universal admiration; nor can I give a better
or a juster idea of the chivalrous Rajput than by inserting a
literal translation of the letter conveying the account of his
death, about eight months after my visit to Jodhpur.</p>

<div class='c034'>“Jodhpur, 2d Asarh, or 28th June 1820.</div>

<p class='c001'>“On the last day of Jeth (the 26th June), an hour before daybreak,
the Raja sent the Aligols,<a id='r4.26.56' /><a href='#f4.26.56' class='c013'><sup>[56]</sup></a> and all the quotas of the chiefs,
to the number of eight thousand men, to attack Surthan Singh.
They blockaded his dwelling in the city, upon which for three
watches they kept up a constant fire of great guns and small arms.
Surthan, with his brother Sur Singh, and his kindred and clan,
after a gallant defence, at length sallied forth, attacked the
foreigners sword in hand, and drove them back. But who can
oppose their prince with success? The odds were too great,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_820'>820</span>and both brothers fell nobly. Nagoji and forty of the bravest
of the clan fell with the Thakur brothers, and forty were severely
wounded. Eighty, who remained, made good their retreat with
their arms to Nimaj.<a id='r4.26.57' /><a href='#f4.26.57' class='c013'><sup>[57]</sup></a> Of the Raja’s troops, forty were killed
on the spot, and one hundred were wounded. Twenty of the
townsfolk suffered in the fray.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The Pokaran chief, hearing of this, saddled; but the Maharaja
sent Sheonath Singh of Kuchaman, the chief of Bhadrajan,
and others, to give him confidence, and induce him to stay; but
he is most anxious to get away. My nephew and fifteen of my
followers were slain on this occasion. The Nimaj chief fell as
became a Rathor. The world exclaims ‘applause,’ and both
Hindu and Turk say he met [708] his death nobly. Sheonath
Singh, Bakhtawar Singh, Rup Singh, and Anar Singh,<a id='r4.26.58' /><a href='#f4.26.58' class='c013'><sup>[58]</sup></a> performed
the funeral rites.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Such is the Rajput, when the point of honour is at stake!
Not a man of his clan would have surrendered while their chief
lived to claim their lives; and those who retreated only preserved
them for the support of the young lord of the Udawats [709]!</p>

<h3 class='c024'>CHAPTER 27</h3>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>City and Fort of Jodhpur.</h4>—The sand, since we crossed the Luni,
had become gradually heavier, and was quite fatiguing as we
approached the capital of “the region of death”; but the
Marwaris and the camels appeared to move through it as briskly
as our men would on the plains of the Ganges. The view before
the reader will give a more correct idea of the ‘city of Jodha’
than the most laboured description. The fort is erected on a
mole projecting from a low range of hills, so as to be almost
isolated, while, being higher than the surrounding objects, it is
not commanded. This table-ridge (mountain we can scarcely
term it, since its most elevated portion is not more than three
hundred feet in height) is a curious feature in these regions of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_821'>821</span>uninterrupted aridity. It is about twenty-five miles in length,
and, as far as I could determine from a bird’s-eye view and from
report, between two and three in breadth, the capital being placed
on the highest part at the southern extremity, and may be said
to be detached from it. The northern point, which is the highest,
and on which the palace is built, is less than three hundred feet.
Everywhere it is scarped, but especially at this point, against
which the batteries of the League<a id='r4.27.1' /><a href='#f4.27.1' class='c013'><sup>[1]</sup></a> were directed in 1806, at least
a hundred and twenty feet of perpendicular height. Strong walls
and numerous round and square towers encircle the crest of the
hill, encompassing a space of great extent, as may be judged from
the dimensions of the base, said to be four miles in circuit. Seven
barriers are thrown across the circuitous ascent, each having
immense portals and their separate guards. There are two small
lakes under the walls: the Rani Talab, or ‘Queen’s Lake,’ to the
east; and the Gulab Sagar, or ‘Rose-water Sea,’ to the south,
from [710] which the garrison draws up water in buckets. There
is also inside a <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>kund</em></span>, or reservoir, about ninety feet in depth,
excavated from the rock, which can be filled from these tanks;
and there are likewise wells within, but the water is brackish.
Within are many splendid edifices, and the Raja’s residence is a
succession of palaces, each prince since the founder having left
memorials of his architectural taste. The city to the eastward
of the citadel is encompassed by a strong wall, three coss, or
nearly six miles, in extent, on which a hundred and one bastions
or towers are distributed; on the rampart are mounted several
<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>rahkalas</em></span><a id='r4.27.2' /><a href='#f4.27.2' class='c013'><sup>[2]</sup></a> or swivels. There are seven gates to the capital, each
bearing the name of the city to which it leads. The streets are
very regular, and adorned with many handsome edifices of freestone,
of which the ridge is composed. The number of families
some years ago was stated to be 20,000, probably 80,000 souls,

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Reception by the Rāja.</h4>—On the 4th the Raja received us with
due form, advancing beyond the second gate of descent; when,
after salutations and greetings, he returned according to etiquette.
Giving him time to make his arrangements, we advanced slowly
through lines of his clansmen to the upper area, where a display
of grandeur met our view for which we were totally unprepared,
and far eclipsing the simple and unostentatious state of the Rana.
Here everything was imitative of the imperial court of Delhi,
where the Rathor, long pre-eminent, had “the right hand of the
king of the world.” Lines of gold and silver mace-bearers
deafened us with the titles of “Raj-Raj-Iswara!” ‘the king,
the lord of kings!’ into whose presence, through mazes of intricate
courts filled with his chivalry, all hushed into that mysterious
silence which is invariably observed on such occasions, we were
at length ushered [711].</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Rāja Mān Singh.</h4>—The King of Maru arose from his throne,
and advanced a few paces, when he again courteously received
the envoy and suite, who were here introduced. The hall of
reception was of great extent: from its numerous square columns
it is styled Sahas stambha, ‘the thousand-columned hall.’ They
were more massive than elegant; and being placed in parallel
rows, at not more than twelve feet from each other, they gave
an air of cumbrous, if not clumsy grandeur to an immense apartment,
the ceiling of which was very low. About the centre, in a
niche or recess, the royal <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>gaddi</em></span> or ‘cushion’ was placed, over
which was raised a richly embroidered canopy, supported by
silver-gilt columns. On the Rana’s right hand were placed those
whom the king honoured, the chieftains of Pokaran and Nimaj,
who would have been less at their ease had they known that all
the distinctions they then enjoyed were meshes to ensnare them.
Several other chieftains and civil officers, whose names would but
little interest the reader, were placed around. The wakil, Bishan
<span class='pageno' id='Page_823'>823</span>Ram, was seated near me, almost in front of the Raja. The
conversation was desultory and entirely complimentary; affording,
however, abundant opportunity to the Raja to display his
proficiency in that mixed language, the Hindustani, which he
spoke with great fluency and much greater purity than those who
resided about the court at Delhi. In person the Raja is above
the common height, possessing considerable dignity of manner,
though accompanied by the stiffness of habitual restraint. His
demeanour was commanding and altogether princely; but there
was an entire absence of that natural majesty and grace which
distinguished the prince of Udaipur, who won without exertion
our spontaneous homage. The features of Raja Man are good:
his eye is full of intelligence; and though the ensemble of his
countenance almost denotes benevolence, yet there is ever and
anon a doubtful expression, which, with a peculiarly formed
forehead, gave a momentary cast of malignity to it. This might
have been owing to that deep dissimulation, which had carried
him through a trial of several years’ captivity, during which he
acted the maniac and the religious enthusiast, until the assumed
became in some measure his natural character.</div>

<p class='c001'>The biography of Man Singh would afford a remarkable picture
of human patience, fortitude, and constancy, never surpassed in
any age or country. But in this school of adversity he also took
lessons of cruelty: he learned therein to master or rather disguise
his passions; and though he showed not the ferocity of the tiger,
he acquired [712] the still more dangerous attribute of that
animal—its cunning. At that very time, not long after he had
emerged from his seclusion, while his features were modelled into
an expression of complaisant self-content, indicative of a disdain
of human greatness, he was weaving his web of destruction for
numberless victims who were basking in the sunshine of his
favour. The fate of one of them has been already related.<a id='r4.27.5' /><a href='#f4.27.5' class='c013'><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Descent of the Rāthors.</h4>—The Rathor, like many other dynasties
not confined to the East, claims celestial descent. Of their Bhat,
we may say what Gibbon does of the Belgic genealogist who
traced the illustrious house of Este from Romulus, that “he riots
in all the lust of fiction, and spins from his own bowels a lineage
of some thousand years.” We are certain that there were
sovereigns of Kanauj in the fifth century, and it is very probable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_824'>824</span>that they ruled there prior to the era of Christianity. But this is
accounted nothing by these lovers of antiquity, who never stop
short of Swayambhuva,<a id='r4.27.6' /><a href='#f4.27.6' class='c013'><sup>[6]</sup></a> and the ark, in which the antediluvian
records of the Rathors may have been preserved with those of
the De Courcys. But we will not revert to those “happy times,
when a genealogical tree would strike its root into any soil, and
the luxuriant plant could flourish and fructify without a seed of
truth.” Then the ambition of the Rathor for a solar pedigree
could be gratified without difficulty.</div>

<p class='c001'>But it requires neither Bhat nor bard to illustrate its nobility:
a series of splendid deeds which time cannot obliterate has
emblazoned the Rathor name on the historical tablet. Where
all these races have gained a place in the temple of fame, it is
almost invidious to select; but truth compels me to place the
Rathor with the Chauhan, on the very pinnacle. The names of
Chonda and Jodha are sufficient to connect Siahji, the founder,
a scion of Kanauj, with his descendant, Raja Man:<a id='r4.27.7' /><a href='#f4.27.7' class='c013'><sup>[7]</sup></a> the rest</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Let us, therefore, put forth our palm to receive the itr from his
august hand, and the pan, acknowledged by a profound salaam,
and bringing the right hand to my cocked hat, which etiquette
requires we should “apply to the proper use:—’tis for the head,”
even in the presence. At all the native courts the head is covered,
and the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>en bas</em></span> left bare. It would be sadly indecorous to walk
in soiled boots over their [713] delicate carpets, covered with
white linen, the general seat. The slippers are left at the door,
and it is neither inconvenient nor degrading to sit in your socks.
The Raja presented me with an elephant and horse caparisoned,
an aigrette, necklace, brocades, and shawls, with a portion according
to rank to the gentlemen who accompanied me.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the 6th I paid the Raja another visit, to discuss the affairs
of his government. From a protracted conversation of several
hours, at which only a single confidential personal attendant of
the prince was present, I received the most convincing proofs of
his intelligence, and minute knowledge of the past history, not of
his own country alone, but of India in general. He was remarkably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_825'>825</span>well read; and at this and other visits he afforded me much
instruction. He had copies made for me of the chief histories of
his family, which are now deposited in the library of the Royal
Asiatic Society. He entered deeply into the events of his personal
history, and recounted many of the expedients he was obliged to
have recourse to in order to save his life, when, in consequence of
the murder of his Guru (not only his spiritual but his temporal
guide, counsellor, and friend), he relinquished the reins of power,
and acquiesced in their assumption by his son. The whole transaction
is still involved in mystery, which the Raja alone can
unravel. We must enter so far into the State secrets of the court
as to disclose the motive for such an act as the destruction of
the brave Surthan, and introduce to the reader another high
priest of the Rajputs as a pendant for the oracle of the Apollo of
Nathdwara.</p>

<p class='c001'>The parricidal murder of Raja Ajit has been the destruction of
Marwar, and even “unto the third and fourth generation”
Providence would seem to have visited the act with its vengeance.
The crown, which in a few years more would have been transmitted
by nature’s law, was torn from the brow of this brave
prince, who has redeemed his lost inheritance from Aurangzeb,
by the unhallowed arm of his eldest son Abhai Singh; instigated
thereto by an imperial bribe of the viceroyalty of Gujarat. His
brother, Bakhta Singh, was made almost independent in Nagor
by the concession of Abhai and the sanad and titles of his
sovereign; and the contests between their issue have moistened
the sands of Marwar with the richest blood of her children. Such
is the bane of feudal dominion—the parent of the noblest deeds
and the deepest crimes.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Deonāthji, the High Priest.</h4>—Raja Man, accordingly, came to
the throne with all the advantages and [714] disadvantages of
such a state of things; and he was actually defending his existence
in Jalor against his cousin and sovereign, when an unexpected
event released him from his perils, and placed him on the throne.
Bhim Singh had destroyed almost every branch of the blood-royal,
which might have served as a nucleus for those intestine
wars which desolated the country, and young Man, the sole intervening
obstacle to the full accomplishment of his wishes, was
reduced to the last extremity, and on the eve of surrendering
himself and Jalor to this merciless tyrant, when he was relieved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_826'>826</span>from his perilous situation. He attributed his escape to the
intercession of the high priest of Marwar, the spiritual leader of
the Rathors. This hierarch bore the title of divinity, or Nathji:
his praenomen of Deo or Deva was almost a repetition of his title;
and both together, Deonath, cannot be better rendered than by
‘Lord God.’ Whether the intercession of this exalted personage
was purely of a moral nature, as asserted, or whether Raja Bhim
was removed from this vain world to the heaven of Indra by
means less miraculous than prayer is a question on which various
opinions are entertained; but all agree that nothing could have
been better timed for young Man, the sole victim required to fill
up the measure of Bhim’s sanguinary policy. When suicide was
the sole alternative to avoid surrender to the fangs of this Herod
of the Desert, the high priest, assuming the mantle of prophecy,
pronounced that no capitulation was inscribed in the book of
fate—whose page revealed brighter days for young Man. Such
prophets are dangerous about the persons of princes, who seldom
fail to find the means to prevent their oracles from being demented.
A dose of poison, it is said, was deemed a necessary
adjunct to render efficacious the prayers of the pontiff; and
they conjointly extricated the young prince from a fate which
was deemed inevitable, and placed him on the regal cushion of
Marwar. The gratitude of Raja Man had no limits—no honours,
no grants were sufficient to mark his sense of obligation. The
royal mantle was hallowed by the tread of this sainted being;
and the throne itself was exalted when Deonath condescended
to share it with his master, who, while this proud priest muttered
forth his mysterious benedictions, with folded hands stood before
him to receive the consecrated garland. Lands in every district
were conferred upon the Nath, until his estates, or rather those
of the church of which he was the head, far exceeded in extent
those of the proudest nobles of the land, his income [715]
amounting to a tenth of the revenues of the State. During the
few years he held the keys of his master’s conscience, which were
conveniently employed to unlock the treasury, he erected no less
than eighty-four mandirs, or places of worship, with monasteries
adjoining them, for his well-fed lazy chelas or disciples, who
lived at free quarters on the labour of the industrious. Deonath
was a striking example of the identity of human nature, under
whatever garb and in whatever clime; whether under the cowl
<span class='pageno' id='Page_827'>827</span>or the coronet, in the cold clime of Europe, or in the deserts of
India. This Wolsey of Marudes exercised his hourly-increasing
power to the disgust and alienation of all but his infatuated
prince. He leagued with the nominal minister, Induraj, and
together they governed the prince and country. Such characters,
when exceeding the sphere of their duties, expose religion to
contempt. The degradation which the haughty grandees of
Marwar experienced made murder in their eyes a venial offence,
provoked as they were by the humiliations they underwent
through the influence of this arrogant priest, whose character
may be given in the language of Gibbon, merely substituting
Deonath of Marwar for Paul of Samosata: “His ecclesiastical
jurisdiction was venal and rapacious; he extorted frequent
contributions from the most opulent of the faithful, and converted
to his own use a considerable part of the public revenue.
His council chamber and his throne, the splendour with which
he appeared in public, the suppliant crowd who solicited his
attention, and the perpetual hurry of business in which he was
involved, were circumstances much better suited to the state of
a civil magistrate than to the humility of a primitive bishop.”<a id='r4.27.8' /><a href='#f4.27.8' class='c013'><sup>[8]</sup></a>
But his “full-blown pride” at length burst under him. Sequestrations
from the estates of the chief barons of Maru became frequent
in order to swell his rent-roll for the support of his establishments;
his retinue on ordinary occasions surpassed that of any chieftain,
and not unfrequently he was attended by the whole insignia of
the State—the prince attending on such ceremonies. On these
occasions the proud Rajput felt that he folded his hands, not to
his sovereign, but to his sovereign’s sovereign; to a vindictive
and vainglorious priest, who, amidst the mummeries and artifices
of religious rites, gratified an inordinate vanity, while he mortified
their pride and diminished their revenues. The hatred of such
men is soon followed by their vengeance; and though they
would not dye their own daggers in his blood, they soon found
agents in a race who know not mercy, the myrmidons of [716]
that villain Amir Khan, under whose steel, and within the precincts
of the palace, Deonath fell a victim. It has been surmised
that Raja Man was privy to the murder; that if he did not
command or even sanction it, he used no means to prevent it.
There are but two in this life who can reveal this mystery—the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_828'>828</span>Raja, and the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>bourreau en chéf</em></span> of Rajasthan, the aforesaid Amir
Khan.</div>

<p class='c001'>The murder of the high priest was but a prolongation of the
drama, in which we have already represented the treacherous
destruction of the chieftain of Pokaran and his kindred; and
the immolation of Krishna Kunwari, the Helen of Rajasthan.
The attack on the gallant Surthan, who conducted us from
Jhalamand to the capital, sprung from the seed which was
planted so many years back; nor was he the last sacrifice:
victim after victim followed in quick succession until the Caligula
of the Desert, who could “smile and stab,” had either slain
or exiled all the first chieftains of his State. It would be a
tedious tale to unravel all these intrigues; yet some of them
must be told, in order to account for the ferocity of this
man, now a subordinate ally of the British Government in the
East.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Accession of Rāja Mān Singh.</h4>—It was in <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1804<a id='r4.27.9' /><a href='#f4.27.9' class='c013'><sup>[9]</sup></a> that Raja
Man exchanged the defence of Jalor for the throne of Jodhpur.
His predecessor, Raja Bhim, left a widow pregnant; she concealed
the circumstance, and when delivered, contrived to convey
the child in a basket to Sawai Singh of Pokaran. During two
years he kept the secret: he at length convened the Marwar
chieftains, with whose concurrence he communicated it to Raja
Man, demanding the cession of Nagor and its dependencies as a
domain for this infant, named Dhonkal Singh, the heir-apparent
of Marwar. The Raja promised compliance if the mother confirmed
the truth of the statement. Whether her personal fears
overcame her maternal affection, or the whole was an imposture
of Pokaran, she disclaimed the child. The chiefs, though not
satisfied, were compelled to appear contented with the result of
this appeal; and for some years the matter seemed at rest. But
this calm was only the presage of a storm, which shook to its
base the political edifice of Marwar, and let loose upon her cities
a torrent of predatory foes; it dethroned her prince, and, what
the planner could not have contemplated, involved his own
destruction. The effects of this treachery have for ever destroyed
all confidence between the chief and the entire feudal interest.
The Pokaran chief, after failing to establish the [717] claims of
Dhonkal Singh as pretender to the throne, sent him for safety
<span class='pageno' id='Page_829'>829</span>to the Shaikhawat chief of Khetri,<a id='r4.27.10' /><a href='#f4.27.10' class='c013'><sup>[10]</sup></a> one of the independent nobles
of the Jaipur family. Here he left him till an opportunity again
arrived to bring him upon the scene, which was afforded by the
contest between the princes of Marwar and Jaipur for the hand
of the Rana’s daughter. This rivalry, the effects of which are
already related, and which brought into conflict all the northern
powers of India, was, in fact, only the under-plot of the deep-laid
policy of Sawai. When once the gauntlet was thrown down
for the hand of this fair lady, the Pokaran chief stepped in with
the pretended son of Raja Bhim, whose cause, from the unpopularity
of Raja Man, soon brought to his standard almost all
the feudality of Marwar. The measures which followed, and
the catastrophe, the death of Krishna Kunwari, have already
been related.<a id='r4.27.11' /><a href='#f4.27.11' class='c013'><sup>[11]</sup></a> The assassination of the chief of Pokaran was
simultaneous with these events; and it was shortly after that
the murder of the pontiff Deonath took place.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Insanity of Rāja Mān Singh.</h4>—After being relieved from all
external foes by his own strength of mind, and the aid of a few
friends whom no reverse could estrange from him, Raja Man
either fell, or affected to fall, into a state of mental despondency
bordering on insanity. Suspicious of every one, he would only
eat from the hands of his wife, who prepared his food herself;
he became sullen and morose; he neglected public business;
and finally withdrew entirely from the world. The attempt to
rouse him from this real or pretended stupor was fruitless; he
did nothing but lament the death of Deonath, and pour forth
prayers to the deity. In this state, he was easily induced to
associate his son in the government, and he bestowed upon him
with his own hand the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>tika</em></span> of command. Chhattar Singh was
the name of the prince, who was still in his minority; thoughtless,
and of dissolute habits, he soon gave himself up to the guidance
of a junta of the chiefs, who proclaimed Akhai Chand, of the
mercantile caste, the chief civil minister of the State.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>British Control of Mārwār. Restoration and Policy of Rāja
Mān Singh.</h4>—Such was the condition of Marwar from <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1809
to 1817. At this period the progress of events made the English
arbiters of the destinies of Rajasthan. The regent of Marwar
sent an ambassador to treat; but before the treaties were ratified
and exchanged the young regent was dead. Various causes were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_830'>830</span>assigned [718] for his death: by some his dissolute habits, occasioning
premature decay; by others, with more probability, the
dagger of an indignant Rajput, the honour of whose daughter
he had clandestinely attempted. Upon this event, and the
change of political circumstances, the chiefs had no alternative
but to turn to the secluded prince. If but one half is true that
I have heard, and from authority of high credit, the occupations
of the years which the Raja passed between the murder of the
priest and the death of his son might be deemed an atonement
for the deepest crimes. When messengers announced the fate
of his son, and that State necessity recalled him to the helm of
affairs, he appeared unable to comprehend them. He had so
long acted the maniac that he had nearly become one: his beard
was never touched, and his hair, clotted and foul, gave him an
expression of idiocy; yet throughout these long years he was
resolutely tenacious of life. The party who governed the son
and the State had their own menials to wait upon him, and many
were the attempts to poison him by their means; in avoiding
which his simulated madness was so perfect that they deemed
he had “a charmed life.” But he had one faithful servant, who
throughout this dreadful trial never forsook him, and who carried
him food in his turban to replace that which was suspected.
When by degrees he was led to understand the emergency, and
the necessity of leaving his prison, he persevered in his apparent
indifference to everything earthly, until he gathered information
and the means for a terrible reaction. The treaty with the
English put the ball at his foot: he very soon perceived that he
might command a force to put down disorder—such was even
volunteered; but with admirable penetration he trusted to the
impression of this knowledge amongst his chiefs, as a sufficient
auxiliary. By disseminating it, he paralysed that spirit which
maintained rights in the soil of Marwar nearly concurrent with
those of the sovereign. No higher compliment could be paid to
British ascendancy than the sentiments of Raja Man and his
nobles; and no better illustration is on record of the opinion of
our power than that its name alone served the Raja’s purpose
in subjugating men, who, scarcely knowing fear, yet reposing
partly on our justice, though mainly on the utter hopelessness of
resisting us, were deprived of all moral courage.</div>

<p class='c001'>In refusing the aid of a mere physical force, the Raja availed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_831'>831</span>himself of another weapon; for by this artifice he threw the
chiefs off their guard, who confided in his [719] assumed desire
to forget the past. Intrigues for power and patronage seemed
to strengthen this confidence; and Salim Singh of Pokaran, the
military Maire du palais or Bhanjgarh, and Akhai Chand, retained
as civil prime minister, were opposed by Jodhraj Singwi, who
headed the aspirants to supplant them. The Raja complained
of their interested squabbles, but neither party dreamed that
they were fostered by him to cloak his deep-laid schemes. Akhai
Chand had been minister throughout the son’s administration;
the political and pecuniary transactions of the State were known
chiefly to him; to cut him off would have been poor revenge,
and Raja Man was determined not only to extract from him all
the knowledge of State matters transacted during his seclusion,
but to make himself master of his coffers, and neither would have
been attained by simple murder. Akhai Chand was not blind
to the dangers of his position; he dreaded the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>appui</em></span> his sovereign
derived from the English, and laboured to inspire the Raja with
distrust of their motives. It suited his master’s views to flatter
this opinion; and the minister and his adherents were lulled into
a fatal security.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Maladministration of Rāja Mān Singh.</h4>—Such were the schemes
concocting when I visited this court, which were revealed by
succeeding events. At this time the Raja appeared in a state
of mental depression, involved in difficulties, cautious, fearful
of a false step, and surrounded by the satellites of the miscreant
Akhai Chand, who, if he could no longer incarcerate his person,
endeavoured to seal up the mind of his prince from all communication
with those who might stimulate him to exertion. But all
his arts only served to entangle him in the web then weaving for
his life. The Raja first made him the means of destroying the
most powerful of his chieftains, Surthan being the primary sacrifice
to his sanguinary proscription; many others followed, until the
best of the feudal chieftains sought refuge from his fury in exile,
and found the saran (sanctuary) they sought in the surrounding
States, the majority in Mewar. The day of vengeance at length
arrived, and the minister and his partisans were transferred from
their position at the helm of the State to a dungeon. Deceived
with hopes of life, and compelled by the application of some
summary methods of torture, Akhai Chand gave in a schedule
<span class='pageno' id='Page_832'>832</span>of forty lakhs of property, of which the Raja realized a large
portion, and then dismissed him to the other world. Nagoji, the
kiladar,<a id='r4.27.12' /><a href='#f4.27.12' class='c013'><sup>[12]</sup></a> and Mulji Dandal, both favourites and advisers of the
Raja’s [720] late son, returned on the strength of a general amnesty,
and forgot they had been traitors. The wealth which prodigality
had heaped upon them, consisting of many of the crown jewels,
being recovered, their worldly accounts were settled by a cup of
poison, and their bodies thrown over the battlements. Success,
and the taste of blood, whetted rather than appeased the appetite
of Raja Man. He was well seconded by the new minister, Fateh
Raj, the deadly opponent of Akhai Chand, and all the clan of
Champawats, whom he deemed the authors of the murder of his
brother Induraj, slain at the same time with Deonath. Each
day announced a numerous list of victims, either devoted to
death, or imprisoned and stripped of their wealth. The enormous
sum of a crore of rupees has been stated as the amount of the
confiscations.</div>

<p class='c001'>All these atrocities occurred within six months after my visit
to this court, and about eighteen from the time it was received
into protective alliance with the British Government. The
anomalous condition of all our connexions with the Rajput
States has already been described: and if illustration of those
remarks be required, it is here in awful characters. We had tied
up our own hands: “internal interference” had been renounced,
and the sequestration of every merchant’s property, who was
connected with the Mehta faction, and the exile of the nobles,
had no limit but the will of a bloodthirsty and vindictive tyrant.
The objects of his persecution made known everywhere the unparalleled
hardships of their case, and asserted that nothing but
respect for the British Government prevented their doing themselves
justice. In no part of the past history of this State could
such proscription of the majority of the kin and clan of the prince
have taken place. The dread of our intervention, as an umpire
favourable to their chief, deprived them of hope; they knew that
if we were exasperated there was no saran to protect them. They
had been more than twelve months in this afflicting condition
when I left the country; nor have I heard that anything has been
done to relieve them, or to adjust these intestine broils. It is
abandoning them to that spirit of revenge which is a powerful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_833'>833</span>ingredient in their nature, and held to be justifiable by any means
when no other hope is left them. In all human probability, Raja

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Interview with Rāja Mān Singh.</h4>—Having lifted the mantle
which veiled the future, my reader must forget all that [721] has
been said to the disadvantage of Raja Man, and see only the
dignified, the courteous, and the well-instructed gentleman and
prince. I cannot think that the Raja had coolly formed to himself
the plan of the sanguinary measures he subsequently pursued,
and which it would require a much more extended narrative to
describe. We discoursed freely on past history, in which he was
well read, as also in Persian, and his own native dialects. He
presented me with no less than six metrical chronicles of his house;
of two, each containing seven thousand stanzas, I made a rough
translation. In return, I had transcribed and sent to him Ferishta’s
great <cite>History of the Mahomedan Power in India</cite>, and <cite>Khulasatu-t-tawarikh</cite>,<a id='r4.27.14' /><a href='#f4.27.14' class='c013'><sup>[14]</sup></a>
a valuable epitome of the history of Hindustan. I
little imagined that I should then have to exhibit him otherwise
than his demeanour and instructive discourse made him appear
to me. In our graver conversation I was amused with a
discourse on the rules of government, and instructions for the
guidance of ambassadors, which my better acquaintance with
Chand discovered to be derived from that writer. He carried me,
accompanied by a single domestic, to various apartments in the
palace, whence he directed my view across the vast plains of the
desert, whose monarch I envied not. The low hills in the vicinity
alone broke the continuity of this arid region, in which a few
isolated nim trees were thinly scattered, to remind one of the
absence of all that is grand in vegetation. After a visit of several
hours, I descended to my tent, and found my friends, Captain
Waugh and Major Gough, just returned from a successful chase
of an antelope, which, with the aid of some Rohilla greyhounds,
they had run down. I attributed their success to the heavy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_834'>834</span>sands, on which I have witnessed many pulled down by dogs of
little speed; but the secret was revealed on this animal being
sent to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>cuisinier</cite></span>. On depriving him of his hide, between it
and the flesh the whole carcase was covered with a large, inert,
amorphous white maggot. The flesh was buried in the sands,
and no venison appeared again on my table while in India.<a id='r4.27.15' /><a href='#f4.27.15' class='c013'><sup>[15]</sup></a></div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Mandor. Rāthor Cenotaphs.</h4>—<em>November 8.</em>—I set out early this
morning to ramble amidst the ruins of the ancient capital, Mandor,
an important link in the chain of archaeological research, before
the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>panchranga</em></span>, or ‘five-coloured banner’ of Maru was prostrated
to the crescent. Attended by an escort provided by the Raja,
I left the perambulator behind; but as the journey occupied an
hour and a quarter, and at a very slow pace, the distance must be
under five miles. I proceeded through the Sojat gate, to [722]
gain the road leading to Nagor; shortly after which I passed the
Maha Mandir, or ‘Grand Minster,’ the funds for the erection of
which were provided by Raja Man on his escape from ruin at
Jalor. I skirted the range, gradually decreasing in height for
three miles, in a N.N.E. direction. We then altered our course
to N.N.W., and entered the gorge of the mountains which envelop
all that is hallowed of the relics of the princes of this house. The
pass is narrow; the cliffs are almost perpendicular, in which are
numerous caves, the abodes of ascetics. The remains of fortifications
thrown across, to bar the entrance of the foe to the ancient
capital of the Pariharas, are still visible: a small stream of pure
and sweet water issues from this opening, and had a watercourse
under an archway. After proceeding a little farther, the interval
widened, and passing through the village, which does not exceed
two hundred houses, our attention was attracted by a line of
lofty temples, rising in graduated succession. These proud
monuments proved to be the cenotaphs of the Rathors, erected
on the spots where the funeral pyre consumed the crowned heads
of Maru, who seldom burnt alone, but were accompanied by all
that made life agreeable or poisoned its enjoyment. The small
brook already mentioned flows past the southern extremity of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_835'>835</span>the chief line of monuments, which extend from south to north.
At the former point stands that of Rao Maldeo, the gallant
opponent of Sher Shah, the brave usurper of the throne of the
Moguls. The farther point terminates with that of Maharaja
Ajit Singh; while the princes in regular succession, namely, Sur
Singh, Udai Singh, Gaj Singh, and Jaswant Singh, fill up the
interval.</div>

<p class='c001'>These dumb recorders of a nation’s history attest the epochs
of Marwar’s glory, which commenced with Maldeo, and ended
with the sons of Ajit. The temple-monument of Maldeo, which
yet throws into shade the still more simple shrines of Chonda,
and Jodha, contrasted with the magnificent mausoleum of Raja
Ajit, reads us a lesson on the advancement of luxurious pomp in
this desert State. The progression is uniform, both in magnitude
and elegance, from Maldeo’s who opposed on equal terms the
Afghan king (whose memorable words, “I had nearly lost the
throne of India for a handful of barley,”<a id='r4.27.16' /><a href='#f4.27.16' class='c013'><sup>[16]</sup></a> mark at once the
gallantry and the poverty of those whom he encountered), to the
last great prince Ajit. Even that of Raja Gaj is plain, compared
to his successor’s. These monuments are all erected of a very
close-grained freestone, of a dark brown or red [723] tint, with
sufficient hardness to allow the sculptor to indulge his fancy.
The style of architecture, or rather the composition, is mixed,
partaking both of the Saivite and the Buddhist; but the details
are decidedly Jain, more especially the columns, which are of the
same model as those in Kumbhalmer. I speak more especially
of those of Rajas Jaswant and Ajit, drawings of which, on a large
scale, executed by the Raja’s chief architect, I brought to Europe;
but which it would be too expensive to have engraved. They are
raised on immense terraces, faced with large blocks of well-polished
freestone. That of Jaswant is somewhat ponderous and massive;
but Ajit’s rises with great elegance and perfect symmetry of
proportion.</p>

<p class='c001'>On ascending the terrace you enter through a lofty vaulted
porch supported by handsome columns to the sanctum, which is
a pyramidal temple, four stories in height, in the Saivite style,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_836'>836</span>crowned by the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>sikhar</em></span> and <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>kalas</em></span>, elsewhere described. The
sculptural ornaments are worthy of admiration, both for their
design and effect; and the numerous columns on the basement,
and different stages of ascent, give an air of so much majesty
that one might deem these monuments more fitting sepulture for
the Egyptian Cheops than a shrine—over what? not even the
ashes of the desert king, which were consigned in an urn to the
bosom of the Ganges. If the foundations of these necrological
monuments have been equally attended to with the superstructure,
they bid fair to convey to remote posterity the recollection of as
conspicuous a knot of princely characters as ever followed each
other in the annals of any age or country. Let us place them in
juxtaposition with the worthies of Mewar and the illustrious scions
of Timur, and challenge the thrones of Europe to exhibit such a
contemporaneous display of warriors, statesmen, or scholars.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Where were the lions’ cubs,” I asked of my conductor, “the

who added provinces to his dominions?” He pointed to two
sheds, where the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>kriya karma</em></span><a id='r4.27.17' /><a href='#f4.27.17' class='c013'><sup>[17]</sup></a> was performed; there was</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_837'>837</span>but these lowly sheds told, in more forcible, more emphatic
language, the cause of this abrupt transition from grandeur to
humility than pen ever wrote; and furnished the moral epilogue
to the eventful drama of the lives of these kings of the desert.
Abhai Singh’s parricidal hand bereft his father of life; yet though
his career was one splendid tissue of success and honour, leaving
his dominions more than doubled, the contentions of his issue
with that of his brother Bakhta Singh, alike accessory, it is said,
to the crime, have entailed endless misery upon Marwar, and left
them not the power, if they had the inclination, to house his
ashes. In the same line with the parricide and his brave brother
is the humble monument of the great Bijai Singh, whose life till
towards its close was a continued tide of action. I could not
avoid an exclamation of surprise: “Shame to the country,” I
said, “that has neglected to enshrine the ashes of a name equal
to the proudest!” His three sons, amongst them Zalim Singh,
with the sketch of whom this narrative opened, have their shrines
close to his; and but a few yards removed are those of Raja
Bhim, and his elder brother Guman (who died in his minority),
the father of the reigning prince, Raja Man. The last, which
closed the line, pertained to Chhattar Singh, who, in all probability,
was saved by death from the murder of his parent. I passed it
in disgust, asking who had been so foolish as to entomb his ashes
better than those of some of the worthies of his race? I found
that it was the act of maternal fondness.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Ancestor Worship. Sati.</h4>—The Amavas (the Ides) and the
Sankrantis (when the sun enters a new sign of the Zodiac) of
every month are sacred to the Pitrideva, on which days it is
incumbent on the reigning prince to “give water” to his ancestors.
But the ignorance of my conductor deprived me of much information
which I anticipated [725]; and had I not been pretty well
read in the chronicles of the Rathors, I should have little enjoyed
this visit to a “nation’s dust.” They related one fact, which was
sufficient to inspire horror. No less than sixty-four females
accompanied the shade of Ajit to the mansion of the sun. But
this is twenty short of the number who became Satis when Raja
Budh Singh of Bundi was drowned! The monuments of this
noble family of the Haras are far more explicit than those of the
Rathors, for every such Sati is sculptured on a small altar in the
centre of the cenotaph: which speaks in distinct language the all-powerful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_838'>838</span>motive, vanity, the principal incentive to these tremendous
sacrifices. Budh Singh was a contemporary of Ajit, and one
of the most intrepid generals of Aurangzeb; the period elapsed
is about one hundred and twenty years. Mark the difference!
When his descendant, my valued friend, the Rao Raja Bishan
Singh, died in 1821, his last commands were that none should give
such a proof of their affection. He made me guardian of his
infant heir;—in a few days I was at Bundi, and his commands
were religiously obeyed.</div>

<p class='c001'>In this account are enumerated the monumental relics below
the fort. Upon the mountain, and beyond the walls of the
fortress of Mandor, are the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>dewals</em></span> of Rao Ranmall, Rao Ganga,
and Chonda, who conquered Mandor from the Parihars. Within
a hundred yards of this trio of worthies of this house is a spot
set apart for the queens who die natural deaths. But this is
anticipating; let me in form conduct my readers step by step
from the cemetery of the Rathors to the Cyclopean city of the
Parihars.</p>

<p class='c001'>Whoever has seen Cortona, Volterra, or others of the ancient
Tuscan cities can form a correct idea of the walls of Mandor,
which are precisely of the same ponderous character. It is
singular that the ancient races of India, as well as of Europe (and
whose name of Pali is the synonym of Galati or Keltoi) should,
in equal ignorance of the mechanical arts, have piled up these
stupendous monuments, which might well induce their posterity
to imagine “there were giants in those days.” This western
region, in which I include nearly all Rajputana and Saurashtra,
has been the peculiar abode of these “pastor kings,” who have
left their names, their monuments, their religion and sacred
character as the best records of their supremacy. The Rajpali,
or ‘Royal Pastors,’ are enumerated as one of the thirty-six royal
races of ancient days: the city of Palitana, ‘the abode of the
Pali,’ in Saurashtra (built [726] at the foot of Mount Satrunjaya,
sacred to Buddha), and Pali in Godwar, are at once evidences of
their political consequence and the religion they brought with
them; while the different nail-headed characters are claimed by
their descendants, the sectarian Jains of the present day.<a id='r4.27.18' /><a href='#f4.27.18' class='c013'><sup>[18]</sup></a> There
is scarcely an ancient city in Rajputana whence I have not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_839'>839</span>obtained copies of inscriptions from columns and rocks, or medals,
gold, silver, and copper, bearing this antique character. All are
memorials of these races, likewise termed Takshak, the Scythic
conquerors of India, ancestors of many of the Rajputs, whose
history the antiquary will one day become better acquainted
with. The Parihara, it will be recollected, is one of the four
Agnikulas: races who obtained a footing in India posterior to
the Suryas and Indus. I omitted, however, to mention, in the
sketch of the Pariharas, that they claim Kashmir as the country
whence they migrated into India: the period is not assigned, but
it was when the schismatic wars between the Saivites and
Buddhists were carrying on; and it would appear that the
former found proselytes and supporters in many of these Agnikulas.
But of the numerical extent of the followers of this faith we
have this powerful evidence, namely, that three-fourths of the
mercantile classes of these regions are the descendants of the
martial conquerors of India, and that seven out of the ten and a
half niyats or tribes, with their innumerable branches, still profess
the Jain faith, which, beyond controversy, was for ages paramount
in this country.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Walls of Mandor.</h4>—Let us now ascend the paved causeway
to this gigantic ruin, and leave the description of the serpentine
Nagda, which I threaded to its source in the glen of Panchkunda,
till our return. Half-way up the ascent is a noble <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>baoli</em></span>, or
‘reservoir,’ excavated from the solid rock, with a facing of cut
stone and a noble flight of steps: on which, however, two
enormous <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>gulars</em></span><a id='r4.27.19' /><a href='#f4.27.19' class='c013'><sup>[19]</sup></a> or wild fig-trees have taken root, and threaten

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_840'>840</span>Ages have rolled away since these were raised, and ages will yet
roll on, and find [727] them immovable, unchanged. The immense
blocks are piled upon, and closely fitted to, each other
without any cement, the characteristic of all the Etruscan cities
termed Cyclopean. We might indeed smuggle a section of
Mandor into the pages of Micali,<a id='r4.27.21' /><a href='#f4.27.21' class='c013'><sup>[21]</sup></a> amongst those of Todi or
Volterra, without fear of detection. The walls, following the
direction of the crest of the ridge, are irregular; and having been
constructed long before artillery was thought of, the Parihar or
Pali engineer was satisfied with placing the palace on the most
commanding eminence, about the centre of the fortress. The
bastions or towers are singularly massive, and like all the most
antique, their form is square. Having both fever and ague upon
me, I was incapable of tracing the direction of the walls, so as to
form any correct judgement of the space they enclose; but
satisfied with gaining the summit, I surveyed the ruin from the
site of the palace of the Parihars. The remains, though scanty,
are yet visible; but the materials have been used in the construction
of the new capital Jodhpur, and in the cenotaphs
described. A small range of the domestic temples of the palace,
and some of the apartments, are yet distinctly to be traced; the
sculptured ornaments of their portals prove them to have been
the work of a Takshak or Buddhist architect. Symbolical figures
are frequently seen carved on the large blocks of the walls, though
probably intended merely as guides to the mason. These were
chiefly Buddhist or Jain: as the quatre-feuille, the cross; though
the mystic triangle, and triangle within a triangle ✡<a id='r4.27.22' /><a href='#f4.27.22' class='c013'><sup>[22]</sup></a> (a sign of
the Saivites, only, I believe), was also to be seen. The chief
memorials of the Parihara are a gateway and magnificent Toran,
or triumphal arch, placed towards the south-east angle of the
castle. It is one mass of sculpture; but the pencil was wanting,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_841'>841</span>and I had not leisure even to bring away a rude resemblance of
this memento of some victory of the ancient lords of Mandor.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Thāna Pir.</h4>—A little distance to the northward of my position
is the Than or ‘station’ of a Muhammadan saint, a disciple of
the celebrated Khwaja Kutab, whose shrine at Ajmer is celebrated.
This of Thana Pir,<a id='r4.27.23' /><a href='#f4.27.23' class='c013'><sup>[23]</sup></a> as they call him, was a place of great
resort to the unsanctified Kafirs, the mercenary Sindis and
Afghans, who long prowled about these regions in quest of [728]
prey, or plunder, or both. Nearly in the same direction, beyond
the walls, are the cenotaphs of the early Rathors and the Satis
already mentioned; but tradition’s voice is mute as to the spot
which contains the ashes of the Parihars. To the east and north-east,
nature has formed at once a barrier to this antique castle,
and a place of recreation for its inhabitants; a lengthened chasm
in the whole face, appearing like a dark line, were it not for the
superb foliage of gular, mango, and the sacred bar and pipal,
which rise above the cleft, planted about the fountain and perpendicular
cliffs of the Nagda, and which must have proved a
luxurious retreat to the princes of Mandor from the reverberation
of the sun’s rays on the rock-built palace; for there is but a
scanty brushwood scattered over the surface, which is otherwise
destitute of all vegetation.</div>

<p class='c001'>Let us now descend by the same causeway to the glen of
Panchkunda, where there is much to gratify both the lover of the
picturesque and the architectural antiquary. At the foot of the
causeway, terminated by a reservoir of good water, are two gateways,
one conducting to the gardens and their palaces erected by
the Rathors; the other, to the statues of the Paladins of the
desert. Leaving both for a moment, I pursued the ‘serpentine’
rivulet to its fountain, where</p>

<p class='c017'>I reposed in meditative indolence, overwhelmed with the recollections

<span class='pageno' id='Page_842'>842</span>the Aravalli.<a id='r4.27.24' /><a href='#f4.27.24' class='c013'><sup>[24]</sup></a> A Nai, or barber, performs worship to the manes
of this illustrious Rajput, in whose praise Chand is most eloquent.
Whence the choice of a barber as a priest I know not; but as he
has the universal care of the material portion of the Rajput, being
always chosen as the cook, so there may be reasons for his having
had an interest in the immaterial part in olden days, the tradition
of which may have been lost. There is a piece of sculpture containing
nine figures, said to represent Ravana, who came from
“th’utmost isle Taprobane,”<a id='r4.27.25' /><a href='#f4.27.25' class='c013'><sup>[25]</sup></a> to marry the daughter of the
sovereign of Mandor. There was a lengthened legend to account
for the name of Nagda, or, ‘serpentine,’ being applied to the
[729] rivulet, but it is too long to relate. We must therefore quit
the fountain, where the gallant Prithiraj and his fair bride, the
cause of strife between the Chauhans and Pariharas, may have
reposed, and visit the most remarkable relic within the precincts
of this singular place.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Images of Heroes.</h4>—A short distance from the foot of the
causeway, an archway opens into an enclosed court or area, in
the retired part of which, and touching the mountain, is an
extensive saloon; the roof is supported by a triple row of columns,
of that light form peculiar to the Jains. Here are displayed, in
all “the pomp and circumstance of war,” the statues of the
knights-errant of the desert, armed cap-à-pie, bestriding steeds
whose names are deathless as their riders’, all in the costume of
the times in which they lived. They are cut out of the rock, but
entirely detached from it, and larger than life. Though more
conspicuous for strength than symmetry, the grim visages of
these worthies, apparently frowning defiance, each attended by
his pandu or squire, have a singularly pleasing effect. Each
chieftain is armed with lance, sword, and buckler, with quiver
and arrows, and poniard in his girdle. All are painted; but
whether in the colours they were attached to, or according to the
fancy of the architect, I know not. Before, however, entering
this saloon, we pass a huge statue of Ganesa, placed as the
guardian of the portal, having on each side the two Bhairavas,
sons of the god of war. Then appears the statue of Chamunda
<span class='pageno' id='Page_843'>843</span>(the goddess of destruction), and that of the terrific mother,
Kankali, treading on the black demon Bhainsasur, in whose flank
her tiger-courser has buried his bloodthirsty tongue: in each of
her eight arms she holds a weapon of destruction. The black
Bhairon (son of Time), with a sable flag, bearing argent a horse
courant, marshals the way through the field of blood to his
mother. Between her and the heroes whose lives passed “in
devotion to the sword,” is a statue of the Nathji, or ‘spiritual

<p class='c001'><b>Palace and Gardens.</b>—I now retired to the palace and gardens
built by Raja Ajit; of which, however superb, it is impossible for
the pen to give a definite idea. Suites of colonnaded halls, covered
with sculpture of easy and even graceful execution, some with
screens of lattice-work to secure the ladies from the public gaze,
are on the lower range; while staircases lead to smaller apartments
intended for repose. The gardens, though not extensive,
as may be supposed, being confined within the adamantine walls
reared by the hand of Nature, must be delightfully cool even in
summer. Fountains, reservoirs, and water-courses, are everywhere
interspersed; and though [731] the thermometer in the open
air was 86°,<a id='r4.27.32' /><a href='#f4.27.32' class='c013'><sup>[32]</sup></a> the cold within doors (if this be not a solecism, considering
that there were no doors) was excessive. Some attention
was paid to its culture; besides many indigenous shrubs, it
boasted of some exotics. There was the golden champa,<a id='r4.27.33' /><a href='#f4.27.33' class='c013'><sup>[33]</sup></a> whose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_845'>845</span>aroma is overpowering, and if laid upon the pillow will produce
headache; the pomegranate, at once “rich in flower and fruit”;
the apple of Sita, or Sitaphala, which, from similitude of taste,
we call the custard-apple; a delicious species of the plantain,
whose broad, verdant, glossy leaf alone inspires the mind with
the sensation of coolness; the mogra;<a id='r4.27.34' /><a href='#f4.27.34' class='c013'><sup>[34]</sup></a> the chameli, or jessamine;
and the queen of flowers, the barahmasha,<a id='r4.27.35' /><a href='#f4.27.35' class='c013'><sup>[35]</sup></a> literally the ‘twelve-month,’
because it flowers throughout the year. It is a delightful
spot, and I felt a peculiar interest in it. Let the reader imagine
the picture of a solitary Englishman scribbling amidst the ruins
of Mandor: in front a group of venerable mango-trees; a little
further an enormous isolated tamarind, “planted by the hand of
a juggler in the time of Nahar Rao, the last of the Pariharas,
before whom he exhibited this proof of legerdemain,” and, as the
legend goes, from whose branches the juggler met his death:<a id='r4.27.36' /><a href='#f4.27.36' class='c013'><sup>[36]</sup></a>
amidst its boughs the long-armed tribe, the allies of Rama, were
skipping and chattering unmolested; while beneath, two Rathor
Rajputs were stretched in sleep, their horses dozing beside them,
standing as sedately as the statue of ‘Black Caesar’: a grenadier
Sepoy of my escort parading by a camp-basket, containing the
provender of the morning, completes the calm and quiet scene.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>An Atīt Hermit.</h4>—On the summit of the rock, across the narrow
valley, several <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>guphas</em></span>, or caves, the abode of the hermit Atit,<a id='r4.27.37' /><a href='#f4.27.37' class='c013'><sup>[37]</sup></a>
were in sight. How the brains of these ascetics can stand the
heat and confined air is a wonder, though, if they possessed any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_846'>846</span>portion of that which is supposed to be necessary to the guidance
of the machine, they would scarcely occupy such a position, nor
consequently, the world’s attention. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Mais tout est vanité</em></span>, a cause
which has produced ten times the number of saints that piety
has, and ten times of ten these troglodyte philosophers. Having
walked out on the terrace or house-top of the palace, to catch a
sunbeam and scare away an ague which tormented me, I discovered
one of these animals coiled up on a heap of bat’s dung
[732], in a corner of an apartment of the palace. He was dreadfully
emaciated, and but for the rolling of a pair of eyes in a visage
covered with hair, there was nothing which betokened animation,
much less humanity. There was none but the bat to dispute his
reign, or “the spider which weaves its web in this palace of the
Caesars.” I had no inclination to disturb the process of ratiocination,
or to ask to which sect of philosophers belonged this
Diogenes of Mandor, who might, if he had utterance, have desired
me to walk downstairs, and not intercept the sunbeam for whose
warmth we were competitors. The day was now nearly departed,
and it was time for me to return to my friends in camp. I finished
the evening by another visit to the knights of the desert; and
inscribing my name on the foot of ‘Black Caesar,’ bade adieu to
the ancient Mandor.</div>

<p class='c001'><em>November 13.</em>—The Raja having invited us to a dinner at the
palace, we sallied forth, belted and padded, to partake of Rajput
hospitality. He had made a request which will appear somewhat
strange—that we would send our cuisine, as the fare of the desert
might prove unpalatable; but this I had often seen done at
Sindhia’s camp, when joints of mutton, fowls, and fricassees
would diversify the provender of the Mahratta. I intimated that
we had no apprehension that we should not do justice to the gastronomy
of Jodhpur; however, we sent our tables, and some
claret to drink long life to the king of Marudes. Having paid our
respects to our host, he dismissed us with the complimentary wish
that appetite might wait upon us, and, preceded by a host of gold
and silver sticks, we were ushered into a hall, where we found the
table literally covered with curries, pillaus, and ragouts of every
kind, in which was not forgotten the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>haria mung Mandor ra</em></span>, the
‘green pulse of Mandor,’ the favourite dish, next to <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>rabri</em></span> or maize-porridge,
of the simple Rathor. Here, however, we saw displayed
the dishes of both the Hindu and Musulman, and nearly all were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_847'>847</span>served in silver. The curries were excellent, especially those of
the vegetable tribes made of the pulses, the kakris or cucumbers,
and of a miniature melon not larger than an egg, which grows
spontaneously in these regions, and is transported by kasids, or
runners, as presents, for many hundreds of miles around. The
hall was an entire new building, and scarcely finished; it is
erected on the northern projection of the rock, where the escarpment
is most abrupt, and looks down upon the site of the batteries
of the league of 1806. It is called the Man mahall [733], and, like
the hall of audience, its flat roof is supported by numerous massive
hewn columns. The view from it to the east is extensive, and we
were told that the pinnacle of Kumbhalmer, though eighty miles
distant, has been seen, in those clear days of the monsoon when
the atmosphere is purified, after heavy showers, from the sand
which is held suspended. Great care was taken that our meal
should be uninterrupted, and that we should not be the lions to
an hour’s amusement of the court. There was but one trivial
occurrence to interrupt the decorum and attention of all present,
and that was so slight that we only knew it after the entertainment
was over. One of the menials of the court, either from
ignorance or design, was inclined to evince contumely or bad
breeding. It will be considered perhaps a singular circumstance
that the Hindu should place before a European the vessels from
which he himself eats: but a little fire purifies any metallic vessels
from all such contamination; and on this point the high-blooded
Rajput is less scrupulous than the bigoted Muhammadan, whom
I have seen throw on the ground with contempt a cup from which
his officer had drunk water on a march. But of earthenware
there can be no purification. Now there was a handsome china
bowl, for which some old dowager fancier of such articles would
have almost become a supplicant, which having been filled with
curds to the Sudra Farangis could no longer be used by the prince,
and it was brought by this menial, perhaps with those words, to
my native butler. Kali Khan, or, as we familiarly called him,
‘the black lord,’ was of a temper not to be trifled with; and as the
domestic held it in his hand, saying, “Take it, it is no longer of
any use to us,” he gave it a tap with his hand which sent it over
the battlements, and coolly resuming his work, observed, “That
is the way in which all useless things should be served”; a hint
which, if reported to Raja Man, he seems to have acted on: for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_848'>848</span>not many months after, the minister, Akhai Chand, who dreaded
lest European influence should release his master from his faction
and thraldom, was treated by him in the same manner as the
china bowl by Kali Khan.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Rāja visits the Author.</h4>—<em>November 16.</em><a id='r4.27.38' /><a href='#f4.27.38' class='c013'><sup>[38]</sup></a>—This day had
been fixed for the Raja’s visits to the envoy. In order to display
his grandeur, he sent his own suite of tents, which were erected
near mine [734]. They were very extensive, modelled in every way
after those of the Emperors of Delhi, and lined throughout with
the royal colour, crimson: but this is an innovation, as will
appear from the formulas yet preserved of his despatches, “from
the foot of the throne, Jodhpur.” The tent, in fact, was a palace
in miniature, the whole surrounded by walls of cloth, to keep at
a distance the profane vulgar. The <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>gaddi</em></span>, or royal cushion and
canopy, was placed in the central apartment. At three, all was
noise and bustle in the castle and town; nakkaras were reverberating,
trumpets sounding the alarm, that the King of Maru
was about to visit the Farangi Wakil. As soon as the flags and
pennant were observed winding down ‘the hill of strife’ (Jodhagir),
I mounted, and with the gentlemen of my suite proceeded
through the town to meet the Raja. Having complimented him
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>en route</em></span>, we returned and received him at the tents. The escort
drawn up at the entrance of the tent presented arms, the officers
saluting; a mark of attention which gratified him, as did the
soldier-like appearance of the men. Hitherto, what he had seen
of regulars belonging to the native powers was not calculated to
give him a favourable impression of foot-soldiers, who are little
esteemed by the equestrian order of Rajputana. His visit continued
about an hour, when the shields were brought in, with
jewels, brocades, shawls, and other finery, in all nineteen trays,
being two less than I presented to the Rana of Udaipur. I likewise
presented him with some arms of English manufacture, a
telescope, and smaller things much valued by the Rajputs. After
the final ceremony of perfumes, and itr-pan (which are admirable
hints when you wish to get rid of a tiresome guest, though not so
in this instance), the exterior wall was removed, and showed the
caparisoned elephant and horses, which were part of the khilat.
At the door of the tent we made our salaam, when the Raja gave
me his hand, which, by the by, was his first salutation on receiving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_849'>849</span>me. It is an ancient Rajput custom, and their bards continually
allude to extending the right hand—“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">dextra extenta.</span>”</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Taking Leave of the Rāja.</h4>—<em>November 17.</em><a id='r4.27.39' /><a href='#f4.27.39' class='c013'><sup>[39]</sup></a>—I went to take
leave of the Raja: I had a long and interesting conversation on
this our last interview. I left him in the full expectation that his
energy of character would surmount the difficulties by which he was
surrounded, though not without a struggle, and condign punishment
to some of the miscreants, the misleaders of his son, the assassins
of his minister and high priest, and consequently the authors
of his humiliating and protracted incarceration [735]. Whether
the first gratification of vengeance provoked his appetite, or
whether the torrent of his rage, once impelled into motion, became
too impetuous to be checked, so that his reason was actually
disturbed by the sufferings he had undergone, it is certain he grew
a demoniac; nor could any one, who had conversed with the
bland, the gentlemanly, I might say gentle, Raja Man, have
imagined that he concealed under this exterior a heart so malignant
as his subsequent acts evinced. But the day of retribution must
arrive; the men who wrote that dignified remonstrance, which
is given in another place,<a id='r4.27.40' /><a href='#f4.27.40' class='c013'><sup>[40]</sup></a> will not tamely bear their wrongs, and
as they dare not levy war against their prince, who reposes under
British protection, the dagger will doubtless find a way to reach
him even in “the thousand-columned hall” of Jodhpur.</div>

<p class='c001'>Besides the usual gifts at parting, which are matter of etiquette,
and remain untouched by the individual, I accepted as a personal
token of his favour, a sword, dagger, and buckler, which had
belonged to one of his illustrious ancestors. The weight of the
sword, which had often been “the angel of death,” would convince
any one that it must have been a nervous arm which carried
it through a day. With mutual good wishes, and a request for a
literary correspondence, which was commenced but soon closed,
I bade adieu to Raja Man and the capital of Marwar [736].</p>

  <h3 class='c024'>CHAPTER 28</h3>
</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Nāndla.</h4>—<em>November 19.</em>—We broke ground for Nandla, distant
six miles. The first two miles from the capital was through deep
sand; for the remainder of the journey the red sandstone protruded,
which gives some relief to the footing of the traveller.
About half-way we passed a small sheet of water, called after the
mother of the pretender, Dhonkal Singh, the Shaikhawat Talao.
This lady has constructed a dharmsala, or ‘hall for travellers,’
on its bank, where she has erected a statue of Hanuman, and a
pillar to commemorate her own good works. Not a shrub of any
magnitude occurs, for even the stunted khair<a id='r4.28.1' /><a href='#f4.28.1' class='c013'><sup>[1]</sup></a> is rare in this plain
of sand; which does not, however, appear unfavourable to the
moth,<a id='r4.28.2' /><a href='#f4.28.2' class='c013'><sup>[2]</sup></a> a vetch on which they feed the cattle. Near the village
we crossed the Jogini, the same stream which we passed between
Jhalamand and the capital, and which, joined by the Nagda from
Mandor, falls into the Luni. The only supply of water for Nandla
is procured from two wells dug on the margin of the stream. The
water is abundant, and only four feet from the surface, but
brackish. There are a hundred and twenty-five houses in Nandla,
which is in the fief of the chieftain of Ahor. A few cenotaphs are
on the banks of a tank, now dry. I went to look at them, but
they contained names “unknown to fame.”</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Bīsalpur.</h4>—Bisalpur, the next place, is distant six estimated
coss of the country, and [737] thirteen miles one furlong by the
perambulator: heavy sand the whole way. Nevertheless we saw
traces of the last autumnal crop of bajra and juar, two species of
millet, which form the chief food of the people of the desert;
and the vetch was still in heaps. Bisalpur is situated on a rising
ground; the houses are uniform in height and regularly built,
and coated with a compost of mud and chaff, so that its appearance
is picturesque. It is protected by a circumvallation of
thorns, the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>kanta-ka-kot</em></span> and the stacks of chaff, as described at
Indara. They are pleasing to the eye, as is everything in such
a place which shows the hand of industry. There was an ancient
city here in former days, which was engulfed by an earthquake,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_851'>851</span>though part of a gateway and the fragment of a wall still mark
its site. No inscriptions were observed. The water is obtained
from a lake.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Pachkalia, Bīchkalia.</h4>—<em>November 21.</em>—Pachkalia, or Bichkalia,
five coss (11 miles 5 furlongs): crossed and encamped on the
Jojri. The soil improving, of a brown sandy texture. Wheat
and barley of excellent quality are grown on the banks of the
river. It was a relief to meet once more a babul or a nim tree;
even our Godwar cypress reared its head on the margin of the
Jojri. Although now only containing a hundred houses, this
was once a place of some importance. I found a defaced inscription,
in which “the son of Sonang, S. 1224,” was still legible;
but the mercenary Pathans have ruined the harvest of the
antiquary. The village is a grant in fee to a Bhatti chieftain.
Water is obtained from wells excavated on the margin of the
river.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Pīpār.</h4>—<em>November 22.</em>—Pipar, four coss (8 miles 2 furlongs).
Pursued the course of the river, the most extended arm of the
Luni, coming from the hills near Parbatsar, on the frontiers of
Jaipur. Its course is marked by the trees already mentioned.
The soil, a mixture of black earth and sand, is termed <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>dhamani</em></span>.
Pipar is a town of 1500 houses, one-third of which are inhabited
by the Oswals of the Jain faith, the chief merchants of all their
country. There are also about two hundred families of Mahesris,
or merchants of the Saiva caste. Pipar carries on a considerable
traffic, and has a chintz manufactory, which employs thirty
families. It is in the grant of the feudal chief of Nimaj, whose
death has been already related. A cenotaph, dedicated to one
of his ancestors, has been half destroyed by the Goths of India.
Pipar is celebrated in the traditions of the desert as one of the
cities [738] founded by Gandharvasen, the Pramara monarch of
Avanti, prior to the Christian era.<a id='r4.28.3' /><a href='#f4.28.3' class='c013'><sup>[3]</sup></a> The only inscription I discovered
was in a temple of the sea-goddess Lakshmi. It bore
the names of Bijai Singh and Delanji, Rajputs of the Guhilot
race, with the ancient title of Rawal. It was a happy confirmation
of the most ancient chronicle of Mewar, which divides the
Guhilots into twenty-four <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>sakha</em></span> or branches, of which one is
called ‘Piparia,’ doubtless from their having conquered this
tract from the Takshak Pramara.</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_852'>852</span>There is an abundance of wells, from sixty to eighty feet in
depth. Of one recently excavated, I obtained the following
details of the strata, which may be gratifying to the geologist.
The first twenty feet are composed entirely of that kind of earth
called <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>dhamani</em></span>, chiefly decomposed sandstone with a mixture
of black earth, in which occurs a stratum of bluish clay mixed
with particles of quartz: this earth is called <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>morar</em></span> in Marwar,
and <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>morand</em></span> in Jaipur. It was then necessary to cut through a
rock of red granite<a id='r4.28.4' /><a href='#f4.28.4' class='c013'><sup>[4]</sup></a> for thirty feet; then several feet of an almost
milk-white steatite, succeeded by stalactitic concretions of sandstone
and quartz.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Legend of the Sāmpu Lake.</h4>—Good water is also obtained from
a lake called the Sampu, which is connected with the tradition of
the foundation of Pipar. A Brahman of the Pali tribe, whose
name was Pipa, was in the habit of carrying milk to a deity of
the Serpent (Takshak) race, whose retreat was on the banks of
this lake, and who deposited two pieces of gold in return for the
Paliwal’s offering. Being compelled to go to Nagor, he gave
instructions to his son to perform his charitable office; but the
youth, deeming it a good opportunity to become master of the
treasure, took a stick with him, and when the serpent issued
forth for his accustomed fare, he struck him violently; but the
snake being “scotched, not killed,” retreated to his hole. The
young Brahman related his adventure to his mother; when
the good woman, dreading the vengeance of the serpentine
deity, prepared a servant and bullock to convey her son to his
father at Nagor. But what was her horror in the morning,
when she went to call the youth, to find, instead of him, the
huge serpent coiled up in his bed! Pipa, on his return, was
inconsolable; but stifling his revenge, he propitiated the serpent
with copious libations of milk. The scaly monster was conciliated,
and revealed the stores he guarded to Pipa, commanding
him to raise a monument which would transmit a knowledge
of the event to future ages [739]. Hence Pipar arose from
Pipa the Pali, and the name of the lake Sampu, from his benefactor
the ‘serpent’ (sampa). All these allegorical tales regard
the Takshak races, the followers of the religion of Buddha or
Jaina, and their feuds with the Brahmanical sects. It is evident
that Pipa the Pali worshipped both; and the very name
<span class='pageno' id='Page_853'>853</span>induces a belief that the whole Paliwal caste are converts from
Buddhism.<a id='r4.28.5' /><a href='#f4.28.5' class='c013'><sup>[5]</sup></a></div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Lākha Phulāni.</h4>—There is a kund or fountain, called after
Lakha Phulani, who ruled in ancient times at Phulra, in the
farther corner of the desert, but carried his arms even to the
ocean. Wherever I have travelled, tradition is loud in praise
of Phulani, from the source of the Luni to its embouchure in the
Delta of the Indus.<a id='r4.28.6' /><a href='#f4.28.6' class='c013'><sup>[6]</sup></a></div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Mādreo.</h4>—<em>November 23.</em>—Madreo, five coss (10 miles 2 furlongs).
Roads good; soil as yesterday, but the country very desolate;
only stunted shrubs since we removed from the margin of the
river. This is a moderate-sized village, with a tank of good water.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Bharūnda.</h4>—<em>November 24.</em>—Bharunda, four coss, or eight miles.
The face of the country now changes materially; our route was
over a low undulating ridge of sandstone, in which the stunted
shrubs of this region find a bed. At one time the elevation was
sufficiently great to allow the chasm through which the road
passed to be dignified with the name of the Ghasuria Pass, in
which a party of the Raja’s men is posted for defence, and
the levy of transit duties. Bharunda is in the fief of Gopal
Singh, the chief of Kuchaman, one of the most conspicuous
of the Mertia clan. It consists of one hundred and fifty
houses; the cultivators are Jats, as are those of all the preceding
villages.</div>

<p class='c001'>I paid a visit to the humble cenotaphs of Bharunda; one of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_854'>854</span>them bore the name of Badan Singh, a sub-vassal of Kuchaman,
who was slain in the heroic charge against De Boigne’s brigades,
in the patriot field of Merta. His name claims the admiration
of all who esteem loyalty and patriotism, the inherent virtues of
the chivalrous Rajput. Raja Bijai Singh had resumed Bharunda,
when the Thakur [740] retired to the adjacent court of Jaipur,
where he was well received according to the hospitable customs
of the Rajput, and had risen to favour at the period when the
Mahrattas invaded his <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>bapota</em></span>, ‘the land of his fathers.’ Resentment
was instantly sacrificed at the altar of patriotism; he put
himself at the head of one hundred and fifty horse, and flew to
his sovereign’s and his country’s defence. Unhappily, the whole
Mahratta army interposed between him and his countrymen.
To cut their way through all impediments was the instant resolve
of Badan and his brave companions. They fell sword in hand
upon a multitude; and, with the exception of a few, who forced
their way (amongst whom was the chief whose monument is referred
to), they were cut to pieces. Badan Singh lived to reach his
ancient estate, which was restored to his family in token of his
sovereign’s gratitude for the gallant deed. It is valued at seven
thousand rupees annual rent, and has attached to it, as a condition,
the service of defending this post. There was another small
altar erected to the manes of Partap, who was killed in the defence
of this pass against the army of Aurangzeb.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Indāwar.</h4>—<em>November 25.</em>—Indawar, five coss (10 miles 2 furlongs).
This place consists of two hundred houses; the cultivators
are Jats. I have said little of these proprietors of the soil,
a sturdy, independent, industrious race, who “venerate the
plough,” and care little about the votaries of Mars or their concerns,
so that they do not impose excessive taxes on them. They
are a stout, well-built, though rather murky race. The village
is assigned to the ex-prince of Sind, who derives his sole support
from the liberality of the princes of Marwar. He is of the tribe
called Kalhora,<a id='r4.28.7' /><a href='#f4.28.7' class='c013'><sup>[7]</sup></a> and claims descent from the Abbassides of Persia.
His family has been supplanted by the Talpuris, a branch of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_855'>855</span>Numris (the foxes) of Baluchistan, who now style themselves
Afghans, but who are in fact one of the most numerous of the
Getae or Jat colonies from Central Asia. But let us not wander
from our subject.</div>

<p class='c001'>I will beg the reader to descend seventy or eighty feet with
me to view the stratification of Indawar. First, three feet of good
soil; five feet of red sandy earth, mixed with particles of quartz;
six feet of an unctuous indurated clay;<a id='r4.28.8' /><a href='#f4.28.8' class='c013'><sup>[8]</sup></a> [741]—then follows a
sand-rock, through which it was necessary to penetrate about
sixty feet; this was succeeded by twenty feet of almost loose
sand, with particles of pure quartz embedded; nodules and
stalactitic concretions of sandstone, quartz, and mica, agglutinated
together by a calcareous cement. The interior of the well throughout
this last stratum is faced with masonry: the whole depth is
more than sixty-five cubits, or forty yards. At this depth a
spring of excellent water broke in upon the excavators, which
supplies Indawar.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Merta.</h4>—<em>November 26.</em>—Merta, four coss (9 miles 1 furlong).
The whole march was one extended plain; the Aravalli towering
about twenty-five miles to our right. To the west a wide waste,
consisting of plains gently undulating, and covered with grass
and underwood. Natural sterility is not the cause of this desert
aspect, for the soil is rich; but the water is far beneath the
surface, and they cannot depend upon the heavens. Juar, moth,
and sesamum were cultivated to a considerable extent in the
immediate vicinity of the villages, but the product had this season
been scanty. The appearance of the town is imposing, its site
being on a rising ground. The spires of the mosque which was
erected on the ruins of a Hindu temple by the tyrant Aurangzeb
overtop the more ponderous and unaspiring mandirs which
surround it. Notwithstanding, this monarch was the object of
universal execration to the whole Hindu race, more especially
to the Rathors (whose sovereign, the brave Jaswant, together
with his elder son, he put to death by poison, and kept Ajit twenty
long years from his birthright, besides deluging their fields with
the richest blood of his nobles); still, such is Hindu toleration,
that a marble is placed, inscribed both in Hindi and Persian,
to protect the mosque from violence. This mark of liberality
proceeded from the pretender Dhonkal Singh, as if with a view
<span class='pageno' id='Page_856'>856</span>of catching golden opinions from the demoralized Pathans, by
whose aid he hoped to regain his rights. But how was he deceived!
His advances were met by the foul assassination, at one fell
swoop, of all his party, by the chief of these mercenaries, Amir
Khan.</div>

<p class='c001'>Merta was founded by Rao Duda of Mandor, whose son, the
celebrated Maldeo, erected the castle, which he called Malkot.<a id='r4.28.9' /><a href='#f4.28.9' class='c013'><sup>[9]</sup></a>
Merta, with its three hundred and sixty townships, became the
appanage of his son Jaimall, and gave its name of Mertia to the
bravest of the brave clans of the Rathors. Jaimall [742] was
destined to immortalize his name beyond the limits of Maru.
Distrusted by his father, and likely to be deserving of suspicion,
from the very ruse to which Sher Shah acknowledged he owed
his safety, he was banished from Marwar. He was hospitably
received by the Rana, who assigned to the heir of Mandor the
rich district of Badnor, equalling his own in extent, and far richer
in soil than the plains he had abandoned. How he testified his
gratitude for this reception, nobler pens than mine have related.
The great Akbar claimed the honour of having with his own
hand sealed his fate: he immortalized the matchlock with which
he effected it, and which was also the theme of Jahangir’s praise,
who raised a statue in honour of this defender of Chitor and the
rights of its infant prince.<a id='r4.28.10' /><a href='#f4.28.10' class='c013'><sup>[10]</sup></a> Abu-l-fazl, Herbert, the chaplain
to Sir T. Roe, Bernier, all honoured the name of Jaimall; and
the chivalrous Lord Hastings, than whom none was better able
to appreciate Rajput valour, manifested his respect by his desire
to conciliate his descendant, the present brave baron of Badnor.<a id='r4.28.11' /><a href='#f4.28.11' class='c013'><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The town of Merta covers a large space of ground, and is enclosed
with a strong wall and bastions, composed of earth to the westward,
but of freestone to the east. All, however, are in a state
of decay, as well as the town itself, which is said to contain twenty
thousand houses. Like most Hindu towns, there is a mixture of
magnificence and poverty; a straw or mud hut adjoins a superb
house of freestone, which “shames the meanness” of its neighbour.
The castle is about a gun-shot to the south-west of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_857'>857</span>town, and encloses an area of a mile and a half. Some small
sheets of water are on the eastern and western faces. There are
plenty of wells about the town, but the water has an unpleasant
taste, from filtering through a stiff clay. There are but two
strata before water is found, which is about twenty-five feet from
the surface: the first a black mould, succeeded by the clay, incumbent
on a loose sand, filled with quartzose pebbles of all hues,
and those stalactitic concretions which mark, throughout the
entire line from Jodhpur to Ajmer, the stratum in which the
springs find a current. There are many small lakes around the
town, as the Dudasar, or ‘lake (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>sar</em></span>) of Duda’; the Bejpa, the
Durani, the Dangolia, etc.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Battlefield.</h4>—The plain of Merta is one continuous sepulchre,
covered with altars to the manes of the warriors who, either in
the civil wars which have distracted this State [743], or in the
more patriotic strife with the southron Goths, have drenched it
with their blood. It is impossible to pass over this memorable
field without a reference to these acts; but they would be unintelligible
without going to the very root of dissension, which
not only introduced the Mahratta to decide the intestine broils
of the Rajput States, but has entailed a perpetuity of discord
on that of Marwar. I have already succinctly related the parricidal
murder of Raja Ajit, which arose out of the politics of the
imperial court, when the Sayyids of Barha<a id='r4.28.12' /><a href='#f4.28.12' class='c013'><sup>[12]</sup></a>—the Warwicks of
the East—deposed the Emperor Farrukhsiyar, and set up a
puppet of their own. With his daughter (whose marriage with
the emperor originated, as already recorded, the first grant of
land to the East-India Company), he retired to his dominions,
leaving his son Abhai Singh at court, and refusing his sanction
to the nefarious schemes of the Sayyids. They threatened
destruction to Marwar, declaring to the son of Ajit that the only
mode of averting its ruin was his own elevation, and his subservience
to their views, which object could only be obtained by
his father’s deposal and death. Even the reasoning resorted to,
as well as the dire purpose of the miscreants, is preserved, and
may serve as an illustration of Rajput feeling. When Abhai
Singh refused or hesitated, he was asked, “<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>Ma bap ka sakha, ya
zamin ka sakha?</em></span>” which, though difficult to render with accuracy,
may be translated: “Are you a branch (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>sakha</em></span>) of the land or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_858'>858</span>of your parents?” As before said, land is all in all to the Rajput;
it is preferred to everything: Abhai’s reply may therefore be
inferred. Immediate installation was to be the reward of his
revenging the Sayyids. That nature could produce from the
same stock two such monsters as the brothers who effected the
deed, is, perhaps, hardly conceivable, and would, probably, not
be credited, were not the fact proved beyond doubt. I should
desire, for the honour of the Rajput race, whose advocate and
apologist I candidly avow myself, to suppress the atrocious
record: but truth is dearer even than Rajput character. Of
the twelve sons of Ajit, Abhai Singh and Bakhta Singh were the
two elder; both were by the same mother, a princess of Bundi.
To Bakhta Singh, who was with his father, the eldest brother
wrote, promising him the independent sovereignty of Nagor
(where they then were), with its five hundred and fifty-five townships,
as the price of murdering their common sire. Not only
was the wretch unstartled by the proposition, but he executed
the deed with his own hands, under circumstances of unparalleled
atrocity. His [744] mother always dreaded the temperament
and disposition of Bakhta, who was bold, haughty, impetuous,
with a perpetual thirst for action; and she cautioned her husband
never to admit him into his presence after dusk, or when unattended.
But the Raja, whose physical strength was equal to
his bravery, ridiculed her fears, observing, “Is he not my child?
Besides, a slap on the face from me would annihilate the stripling.”
Upon receiving the note from his brother, Bakhta, after taking
leave of his father, concealed himself in a chamber adjoining that
where his parents reposed. When all was still the murderer stole
to the bed in which lay the authors of his existence, and from a
pallet, on which were placed the arms of Ajit, he seized his sword,
and coolly proceeded to exhaust those veins which contained
the same blood that flowed in his own. In order that nothing
might be wanting to complete the deed of horror, the mother
was awakened by the blood of her lord moistening her bosom.
Her cries awoke the faithful Rajputs who lay in the adjacent
apartments, and who, bursting into the chamber, discovered their
prince and father dead: “Treason had done its worst.” The
assassin fled to the roof of the palace, barring the gates behind
him, which resisted all attempts to force them until morning,
when he threw into the court below the letter of his brother,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_859'>859</span>exclaiming, “This put the Maharaja to death, not I.” Abhai
Singh was now their sovereign; and it is the actual occupant of
the throne whom the Rajput deems entitled to his devotion.
Eighty-four Satis took place on this dire occasion, the parent of
these unnatural regicidal and parricidal sons leading the funeral
procession. So much was Ajit beloved, that even men devoted
themselves on his pyre. Such was the tragical end of the great
Ajit, lamented by his chiefs, and consecrated by the bard, in
stanzas in honour of him and in execration of the assassins; which
afford proof of the virtuous independence of the poetic chronicler
of Rajasthan.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Sons of Ajīt Singh.</h4>—Bakhta Singh obtained Nagor; and
Abhai Singh was rewarded with the viceroyalty of Gujarat,
which gift he repaid by aiding in its partition, and annexing the
rich districts of Bhinmal, Sanchor, and others, to Marwar; on
which occasion he added Jalor to the domain of his brother
Bakhta, or, as the bard styles him, <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>bad-bakhta</em></span>, ‘the unfortunate.’
This additional reward of parricide has been the cause of all the
civil wars of Marwar.</div>

<p class='c001'>We may slightly notice the other sons of Ajit, whose issue
affected the political society of Rajputana. Of these,</p>

<p class='c001'>Devi Singh was given for adoption to Maha Singh, head of
the Champawat clan, he having no heirs. Devi Singh then held
Bhinmal, but which he could not retain against the Koli tribes
around him, and Pokaran was given in exchange. Sabal Singh,
Sawai Singh, and Salim Singh (whose escape from the fate of the
chieftain of Nimaj has been noticed) are the lineal issue of this
adoption.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_860'>860</span>Anand Singh, another son of Ajit, was in like manner adopted
into the independent State of Idar, and his issue are heirs-presumptive
to the throne of Marwar.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Effects of Adoption.</h4>—From these races we derive the knowledge
of a curious fact, namely, that the issue of the younger
brother maintains a claim, though adopted into a foreign and
independent State; while all such claims are totally extinguished
by adoption into a home clan. Under no circumstances could
the issue of Devi Singh sit on the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>gaddi</em></span> of Marwar; when
adopted into the Champawat clan, he surrendered all claims
derived from his birth, which were merged into his vassal
rank. Still the recollection must give weight and influence;
and it is evident from the boast of the haughty Devi Singh,
when his head was on the block, that there is danger in these
adoptions.</div>

<p class='c001'>Abhai Singh died, leaving a memorial of his prowess in the
splendid additions he made to his territories from the tottering
empire of Delhi. He was succeeded by his son Ram Singh, on
whose accession his uncle Bakhta sent his aged foster-mother,
an important personage in Rajwara, with the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>tika</em></span> <a id='corr860.20'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='and gifts, and gifts,'>and gifts,</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_860.20'><ins class='correction' title='and gifts, and gifts,'>and gifts,</ins></a></span> and other symbols of congratulation. Ram Singh, who had
all the impetuosity of his race, received the lady-ambassador
with no friendly terms, asking her if his uncle had no better
messenger to salute his new sovereign. He refused the gifts,
and commanded her to tell his uncle to surrender Jalor. The
offended dame [746] extenuated nothing of the insolence of the
message. The reply was, however, courteous, implying that
both Jalor and Nagor were at his disposal. The same sarcastic
spirit soon precipitated matters between them in the following
manner.</p>

<p class='c001'>Kusal Singh of Awa, the premier noble of Marwar, and of all
the clans of Champawat, more brave than courtly, was short in
stature, sturdy, boorish, and blunt; he became the object of his
young sovereign’s derision, who used to style him the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>gurji
gandhak</em></span>, or ‘turnspit dog,’ and who had once the audacity to
say, “Come, gurji”; when he received the laconic reproof:
“Yes; the gurji that dare bite the lion.”</p>

<p>PAIKS OF MĀRWĀR<br /><span class='small'><em>To face page 860.</em></span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Brooding over this merited retort, he was guilty of another
sarcasm, which closed the breach against all reconciliation.
Seated one day in the garden of Mandor, he asked the same chief
<span class='pageno' id='Page_861'>861</span>the name of a tree. “The champa,” was the reply, “and the
pride of the garden, as I am of your Rajputs.” “Cut it down
instantly,” said the prince; “root it out; nothing which bears
the name of champa shall exist in Marwar.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Kaniram of Asop, the chief of the next most powerful clan,
the Kumpawat, was alike the object of this prince’s ridicule.
His countenance, which was not “cast in nature’s finest mould,”
became a butt for his wit, and he would familiarly say to him,
‘<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>ao budha bandar</em></span>,’ “Come along, old monkey.” Boiling with
rage, the chief observed, “When the monkey begins to dance,
you will have some mirth.” Leaving the court, with his brother
chieftain of Awa, they collected their retainers and families, and
marched to Nagor. Bakhta Singh was absent, but being advised
by his locum tenens of his visitors, and of their quarrel with his
nephew, he lost no time in joining them. It is said he expostulated
with them, and offered himself as mediator; but they
swore never again to look in the face of Ram Singh as their
sovereign. They offered to place Bakhta Singh on the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>gaddi</em></span> of
Jodha; and threatened, if he refused, to abandon Marwar. He
played the part of our Richard for a short time; but the habitual
arrogance of his nephew soon brought matters to a crisis. As
soon as he heard that the two leaders of all his vassals were
received by his uncle, he addressed him, demanding the instant
surrender of Jalor. Again he had the courtly reply: “He dare
not contend against his sovereign; and if he came to visit him,
he would meet him with a vessel of water.”<a id='r4.28.15' /><a href='#f4.28.15' class='c013'><sup>[15]</sup></a> War, a [747]
horrid civil war, was now decided on; the challenge was given
and accepted, and the plains of Merta were fixed upon to determine
this mortal strife, in which brother was to meet brother,
and all the ties of kin were to be severed by the sword. The
Mertia clans, the bravest, as they are the most loyal and devoted,
of all the brave clans of Maru, united to a man under the
sovereign’s standard; the chiefs of Rian, Budsa, Mihtri, Kholar,
Bhorawar, Kuchaman, Alniawas, Jusari, Bokri, Bharunda, Irwa,
Chandarun, collected around them every vassal who could wield
a brand. Most of the clans of Jodha, attracted by the name of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_862'>862</span><span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>swamidharma</em></span>, ‘fidelity to their lord,’ united themselves to the
Mertias; though a few, as Ladnun, Nimbi, were on the adverse
side; but the principal leaders, as Khairwa, Govindgarh, and
Bhadrajun, were faithful to their salt. Of the services of others,
Ram Singh’s insolence deprived him. Few remained neuter.
But these defections were nothing to the loss of a body of five
thousand Jareja auxiliaries, whom his connexion with a daughter
of the prince of Bhuj brought to his aid. When the tents were
moved outside the capital, an incident occurred which, while it
illustrates the singular character of the Rajput, may be regarded
as the real cause of the loss of sovereignty to Ram Singh. An
inauspicious raven had perched upon the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>kanat</em></span>, or wall of the
tent in which was the Jareja queen, who, skilled in the art of the
<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>suguni</em></span><a id='r4.28.16' /><a href='#f4.28.16' class='c013'><sup>[16]</sup></a> (augur), determined to avert it. Like all Rajputnis,
who can use firearms on occasion, she seized a matchlock at
hand, and, ere he “thrice croaked,” she shot him dead. The
impetuous Raja, enraged at this instance of audacity and disrespect,
without inquiry ordered the culprit to be dragged before
him; nor was his anger assuaged when the name of the Rani
was given. He reviled her in the grossest terms: “Tell the
Rani,” he said, “to depart my dominions, and to return from
whence she came.” She entreated and conjured him, by a regard
to his own safety, to revoke the decree; but all in vain; and
with difficulty could she obtain a short interview, but without
effecting any change in her obdurate lord. Her last words
were, “With my exile from your presence, you will lose the
crown of Marwar.” She marched that instant, carrying with her
the five thousand auxiliaries whose presence must have ensured
his victory.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Udawat clans, led by their chiefs of Nimaj, Raepur, and
Raus, with all [748] the Karansots under the Thakur of Khinwasar,
united their retainers with the Champawats and Kumpawats
under the banners of Bakhta Singh.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Battle between Bakhta Singh and Rāja Rām Singh, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1752.</h4>—Ram
Singh’s array fell far short of his rival’s since the defection
of the Jarejas; yet, trusting to the name of sovereign as “a
tower of strength,” he boldly marched to the encounter, and
when he reached the hostile field encamped near the Ajmer gate
of Merta. His rival was not long behind, and marshalled his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_863'>863</span>clans within three miles of the northern portal, called the gate
of Nagor. The spot he chose had a sacred character, and was
called Mataji ka Than, where there was a shrine of the Hindu
Hecate, with a fountain said to have been constructed by the
Pandavas.</div>

<p class='c001'>Bakhta Singh commenced the battle. Leaving his camp
standing, he advanced against his nephew and sovereign, whom
he saluted with a general discharge of his artillery. A vigorous
cannonade was continued on both sides throughout the day,
without a single man seeking a closer encounter. It is no wonder
they paused ere the sword was literally drawn. Here was no
foreign foe to attack; brother met brother, friend encountered
friend, and the blood which flowed in the veins of all the combatants
was derived from one common fountain. The reluctance
proceeded from the στοργή, the innate principle of natural
affection. Evening advanced amidst peals of cannon, when an
incident, which could only occur in an army of Rajputs, stopped
the combat. On the banks of the Bejpa lake, the scene of strife,
there is a monastery of Dadupanti ascetics, built by Raja Sur
Singh. It was nearly midway between the rival armies, and the
shot fell so thick amidst these recluses that they fled in a body,
leaving only the old patriarch. Baba (father) Kishandeo disdained
to follow his disciples, and to the repeated remonstrances
from either party to withdraw, he replied, that if it was his fate
to die by a shot he could not avert it; if not, the balls were
innoxious: but although he feared not for himself, yet his
gardens and monastery were not “charmed,” and he commanded
them to fight no longer on that ground. The approach of night,
and the sacred character of the old abbot Dadupanti, conspired
to make both parties obey his commands, and they withdrew to
their respective encampments.</p>

<p class='c001'>The dawn found the armies in battle-array, each animated
with a deadly determination. It was Raja Ram’s turn to open
this day’s combat, and he led the van against his uncle. Burning
with the recollection of the indignities he had [749] suffered, the
chief of Awa, determined to show that “the cur could bite,” led
his Champawats to the charge against his sovereign. Incited by
loyalty and devotion “to the gaddi of Marwar,” reckless who was
its occupant, the brave Mertias met his onset steel in hand. The
ties of kin were forgotten, or if remembered, the sense of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_864'>864</span>unnatural strife added a kind of frenzy to their valour, and
confirmed their resolution to conquer or die. Here the Mertia,
fighting under the eye of this valiant though intemperate prince,
had to maintain his ancient fame, as “the first sword of Maru.”
There his antagonist, the Champawat, jealous of this reputation,
had the like incentive, besides the obligation to revenge the insults
offered to his chief. The conflict was awful: the chieftains of
each valiant clan met hand to hand, singling out each other by
name. Sher Singh, chief of all the Mertias, was the first who
sealed his devotion by his death. His place was soon filled by
his brother, burning for vengeance. Again he cheered on his
Mertias to avenge the death of their lord, as he propelled his
steed against the chief of the Champawats. They were the sons
of two sisters of the Jaipur house, and had hitherto lived in amity
and brotherly love, now exchanged for deadly hate. They
encountered, when the “cur” bit the dust, and was borne from
the field. The loss of their leaders only inflamed the vassals on
both sides, and it was long before either yielded a foot of ground.
But numbers, and the repeated charges of Bakhta Singh who
led wherever his nephew could be found, at length prevailed;
though not until the extinction of the clan of Mertia, who,
despising all odds, fought unto the death. Besides their head
of Rian, there fell the sub-vassals of Irwa, Sewara, Jusari,
and Mithri, with his three gallant sons, and almost all their
retainers.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Death of the Mīthri Chief.</h4>—There is nothing more chivalrous
in the days of Edward and Cressy than the death of the heir
of Mithri, who, with his father and brothers, sealed his fealty with
his blood on this fatal field. He had long engaged the hand of a
daughter of a chief of the Narukas, and was occupied with the
marriage rites, when tidings reached him of the approach of the
rebels to Merta. The knot had just been tied, their hands had
been joined—but he was a Mertia—he unlocked his hand from
that of the fair Naruki, to court the Apsaras in the field of battle.
In the bridal vestments, with the nuptial coronet (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>maur</em></span>) encircling
his forehead, he took his station with his clan in the second day’s
fight, and “obtained a bride in Indra’s [750] abode.”<a id='r4.28.17' /><a href='#f4.28.17' class='c013'><sup>[17]</sup></a> The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_865'>865</span>bards of Maru dwell with delight on the romantic glory of the

</div>

<p class='c015'>The paraphernalia here enumerated are very foreign to the
cavalier of the west: “with pearls shining in his ears, and a
golden chaplet round his neck, a space of eighty coss came the
heir of Mithri.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The virgin bride followed her lord from Jaipur, but instead of
being met with the tabor and lute, and other signs of festivity,
wail and lamentation awaited her within the lands of Mithri,
where tidings came of the calamity which at once deprived this
branch of the Mertias of all its supporters. Her part was soon
taken; she commanded the pyre to be erected; and with the
turban and <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>tora</em></span><a id='r4.28.19' /><a href='#f4.28.19' class='c013'><sup>[19]</sup></a> which adorned her lord on this fatal day, she
followed his shade to the mansions of the sun. I sought out the
cenotaph of this son of honour in the blood-stained field; but
the only <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>couronne immortelle</em></span> I could wreathe on the sandy plain
was supplied by the Bardai, whose song is full of martial fire as
he recounts the gallantry of Kunwar Mithriwala.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Mertias, and their compeers on the side of the prince,
made sad havoc amongst their opponents; and they still maintain
that it was owing to the artillery alone that they were
defeated. Their brave and loyal leader, Sher Singh of Rian, had
fruitlessly endeavoured to recall his brother-in-law from the path
of treason, but ineffectually; he spoke with sarcasm of his means
to supplant Ram Singh by his uncle. The reply of the old baron
of Awa is characteristic: “At least I will turn the land upside
down”; to which Sher Singh rejoined, angrily, he would do his
best to prevent him. Thus they parted; nor did they meet
again till in arms at Merta.</p>

<p class='c001'>In surveying this field of slaughter, the eye discerns no <i>point
d’appui</i>, no village or key of position, to be the object of a struggle:
nothing to obstruct the doubly-gorged falconet, which has no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_866'>866</span>terrors for the uncontrollable valour of the Rathor; it perceives
but a level plain, extended to the horizon, and now covered with
the memorials of this day’s strife. Here appears the colonnaded
mausoleum, with its airy cupola; there the humble altar, with
its simple record of the name, clan, and <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>sakha</em></span> of him whose ashes
repose beneath, with the date of the event [751], inscribed in rude
characters. Of these monumental records I had copies made of
about a score; they furnish fresh evidence of the singular character
of the Rajput.</p>

<p class='c001'>Ram Singh retired within the walls of the city, which he
barricaded; but it being too extensive to afford the chance of
defence against the enemy, he formed the fatal resolution of
calling to his aid the Mahrattas, who were then rising into notice.
At midnight he fled to the south; and at Ujjain found the
Mahratta leader, Jai Apa Sindhia, with whom he concerted
measures for the invasion of his country. Meantime his uncle
being master of the field, repaired, without loss of time, to the
capital, where he was formally enthroned; and his <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>an</em></span> was proclaimed
throughout Marwar. As skilful as he was resolute,
he determined to meet on his frontier the threatened invasion,
and accordingly advanced to Ajmer, in order to interpose
between the Mahrattas and Jaipur, whose prince, Isari Singh,<a id='r4.28.20' /><a href='#f4.28.20' class='c013'><sup>[20]</sup></a>
was <a id='corr866.23'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='father-in law'>father-in-law</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_866.23'><ins class='correction' title='father-in law'>father-in-law</ins></a></span> to his rival. He wrote him a laconic epistle,
requiring him either instantly to unite with him in attacking
the Mahrattas, or declare himself his foe. The Jaipur prince
had many powerful reasons for not supporting Raja Bakhta, but
he at the same time dreaded his enmity. In this extremity, he
had recourse to an expedient too common in cases of difficulty.
Concerting with his wife, a princess of Idar (then ruled by one of
the sons of Ajit), the best mode of extrication from his difficulties,
he required her aid to revenge the foul murder of Ajit, and to
recover his son’s right. “In either case,” said he, “the sword
must decide, for he leaves me no alternative: against him I
have no hopes of success; and if I march to the aid of an assassin
and usurper, I lose the good opinion of mankind.” In short,
he made it appear that she alone could rescue him from his perils.
It was therefore resolved to punish one crime by the commission
of another. Isari Singh signified his assent; and to lull all
suspicion, the Rathorni was to visit her uncle in his camp on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_867'>867</span>joint frontier of the three States of Mewar, Marwar, and Amber.
A poisoned robe was the medium of revenge. Raja Bakhta,
soon after the arrival of his niece, was declared in a fever; the
physician was summoned: but the man of secrets, the Vaidya,
declared he was beyond the reach of medicine, and bade him
prepare for other scenes. The intrepid Rathor, yet undismayed,
received the tidings even with a jest: “What, Suja,” said he,
“no cure? Why do you take my lands and eat their produce,
if you cannot combat my maladies? What is your art good for?”
The Vaidya excavated a [752] small trench in the tent, which he
filled with water; throwing into it some ingredient, the water
became gelid. “This,” said he, “can be effected by human
skill; but your case is beyond it: haste, perform the offices
which religion demands.” With perfect composure he ordered
the chiefs to assemble in his tent; and having recommended to
their protection, and received their promise of defending the
rights of his son, he summoned the ministers of religion into his
presence. The last gifts to the church, and these her organs,
were prepared; but with all his firmness, the anathema of the
Satis, as they ascended the funeral pyre on which his hand had
stretched his father, came into his mind; and as he repeated
the ejaculation, “May your corpse be consumed in foreign land!”
he remembered he was then on the border. The images which
crossed his mental vision it is vain to surmise: he expired as he
uttered these words; and over his remains, which were burnt
on the spot, a cenotaph was erected, and is still called Bura Dewal,
the ‘Shrine of Evil.’</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>But for that foul stain, Raja Bakhta would have been one of
the first princes of his race. It never gave birth to a bolder;
and his wisdom was equal to his valour. Before the commission
of that act, he was adored by his Rajputs. He was chiefly
instrumental in the conquests made from Gujarat; and afterwards,
in conjunction with his brother, in defeating the imperial
viceroy, Sarbuland.<a id='r4.28.21' /><a href='#f4.28.21' class='c013'><sup>[21]</sup></a> His elevation could not be called a usurpation,
since Ram Singh was totally incapacitated, through his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_868'>868</span>ungovernable passions, for sovereign sway; and the brave barons
of Marwar, “all sons of the same father with their prince,” have
always exercised the right of election, when physical incapacity
rendered such a measure requisite. It is a right which their
own customary laws, as well as the rules of justice, have rendered
sacred. According to this principle, nearly all the feudality of
Maru willingly recognized, and swore to maintain, the claims of
his successor, Bijai Singh. The Rajas of Bikaner and Kishangarh,
both independent branches of this house, gave in their
assent. Bijai Singh was accordingly proclaimed and installed
at Marot, and forthwith conducted to Merta.</p>

<p class='c001'>The ex-prince, Ram Singh, accompanied Jai Apa to the siege
of Kotah, and subsequently through Mewar, levying contributions
as they passed to Ajmer. Here a dispute occurred between
the brave Rathor and Sindhia, whose rapacious spirit for plunder
received a severe reproof: nevertheless they crossed the frontier
[753], and entered Marwar. Bijai Singh, with all the hereditary
valour of his race, marched to meet the invaders, at the
head of nearly all the chivalry of Maru, amounting to 200,000
men.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Battle of Merta, about <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1756.</h4>—The first day both armies
encountered, they limited their hostility to a severe cannonade
and partial actions, the inhabitants of Merta supplying the combatants
with food, in which service many were killed; even the
recluse Dadupantis ran the risk in this patriotic struggle, and
several of the old patriarch’s disciples suffered. The second
day passed in the same manner, with many desperate charges
of cavalry, in which the Mahrattas invariably suffered, especially
from a select body of 5000 select horse, all cased in armour, which
nothing could withstand. The superior numerical strength of
Ram Singh and his allies compelled Bijai Singh not to neglect
the means of retreat. Throughout the first and second days’
combat, the cattle of the train had been kept yoked; on the
third, they had carried them to a small rivulet in the rear to
water. It was at the precise moment of time when the legion
of cuirassiers were returning from a charge which had broken to
pieces the Mahratta line, as they approached their friends, the
word ‘<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>daga</em></span>’ spread like wildfire; they were mistaken for Ram
Singh’s adherents, and a murderous shower of grape opened
upon the flower of their own army, who were torn to pieces ere
<span class='pageno' id='Page_869'>869</span>the fatal error was discovered. But such was the impression
which this band of heroes had just made on the Mahrattas, that
they feared to take advantage of this disaster. A feeling of
horror pervaded the army of Bijai Singh, as the choice of their
chivalry conveyed the slain and the wounded to the camp. A
council of war was summoned, and the aid of superstition came
to cool that valour which the Mahrattas, in spite of their numbers,
could never subdue. The Raja was young—only twenty years
of age; and being prudent as well as brave, he allowed experience
to guide him. The Raja of Bikaner, of the same kin and clan,
took the lead, and advised a retreat. In the accident related,
he saw the hand of Providence, which had sent it to serve as a
signal to desist. The Raja had a great stake to lose, and doubtless
deemed it wise to preserve his auxiliaries for the defence of
his own dominions. It was a case which required the energy of
Bakhta: but the wavering opinion of the council soon spread
throughout the camp, and was not unobserved by the enemy;
nor was it till Bikaner marched off with his aid, towards the
close of the day, that any advantage was taken of it [754]. Then
Ram Singh at the head of a body of Rajputs and Mahrattas
poured down upon them, and ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>sauve qui peut</em></span>’ became the order
of the day. To gain Merta was the main object of the discomfited
and panic-struck Rathors; but many chiefs with their vassals
marched direct for their estates. The guns were abandoned to
their fate, and became the first proud trophy the Mahrattas
gained over the dreaded Rajputs. The Raja of Kishangarh, also
a Rathor, followed the example of his brother prince of Bikaner,
and carried off his bands. Thus deserted by his dispirited and
now dispersed barons, the young prince had no alternative but
flight, and at midnight he took the route of Nagor. In the darkness
he mistook the road, or was misled into that of Rain, whose
chieftain was the companion of his flight. Calling him by name,
Lal Singh, he desired him to regain the right path; but the
orders of a sovereign at the head of a victorious army, and those
of a fugitive prince, are occasionally received, even amongst
Rajputs, with some shades of distinction. The chief begged permission,
as he was near home, to visit his family and bring them
with him. Too dignified to reply, the young prince remained
silent and the Thakur of Rain<a id='r4.28.22' /><a href='#f4.28.22' class='c013'><sup>[22]</sup></a> loitered in the rear. The Raja
<span class='pageno' id='Page_870'>870</span>reached Kajwana, with only five of his cuirassiers (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>silahposh</em></span>) as
an escort. Here he could not halt with safety; but as he left
the opposite barrier, his horse dropped down dead. He mounted
another belonging to one of his attendants, and gained Deswal,
three miles farther. Here the steeds, which had been labouring
throughout the day under the weight of heavy armour, in addition
to the usual burden of their riders, were too jaded to proceed;
and Nagor was still sixteen miles distant. Leaving his worn-out
escort, and concealing his rank, he bargained with a Jat to convey
him before break of day to the gate of Nagor for the sum of five
rupees. The peasant, after stipulating that the coin should be
bijaishahis,<a id='r4.28.23' /><a href='#f4.28.23' class='c013'><sup>[23]</sup></a> ‘the new currency,’ which still remains the standard,
the common car of husbandry was brought forth, on which the
king of Maru ascended, and was drawn by a pair of Nagori oxen.
The royal fugitive was but little satisfied with their exertions,
though their pace was good, and kept continually urging them,
with the customary cry of “<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>hank! hank!</em></span>“ The honest Jat,
conscious that his cattle did their best, at length lost all temper.
Repeating the sounds ”<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>hank! hank!</em></span>” “Who are you,” asked
he, “that are hurrying on at this rate? It were more becoming
[755] that such a sturdy carl should be in the field with Bijai
Singh at Merta, than posting in this manner to Nagor. One would
suppose you had the southrons (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>dakkhinis</em></span>) at your heels. Therefore
be quiet, for not a jot faster shall I drive.” Morning broke,
and Nagor was yet two miles distant: the Jat, turning round to
view more attentively his impatient traveller, was overwhelmed
with consternation when he recognized his prince. He leaped
from the vehicle, horror-struck that he should have been sitting
‘on the same level’ with his sovereign, and absolutely refused
to sin any longer against etiquette. “I pardon the occasion,”
said the prince mildly; “obey.” The Jat resumed his seat,
nor ceased exclaiming <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>hank! hank!</em></span> until he reached the gate of
Nagor. Here the prince alighted, paid his price of conveyance,
and dismissed the Jat of Deswal, with a promise of further recompense
hereafter. On that day the enemy invested Nagor, but
not before Bijai Singh had dispatched the chief of Harsor to
defend the capital, and issued his proclamations to summon the
ban of Marwar.</div>

<div class='section-start'><span class='pageno' id='Page_871'>871</span><h4 class='disp-inline'>Resistance of Bijai Singh.</h4>—During six months he defended
himself gallantly in Nagor, against which the desultory Mahrattas,
little accustomed to the operations of a siege, made no impression,
while they suffered from the sallies of their alert antagonist.
Encouraged by their inactivity, the young prince, imbued with
all the native valour of his race, and impelled by that decisive
energy of mind which characterized his father, determined upon
a step which has immortalized his memory. He resolved to cut
his way through the enemy, and solicit succours in person. He
had a dromedary corps five hundred strong. Placing on these
a devoted band of one thousand Rajputs, in the dead of night
he passed the Mahratta lines unobserved, and made direct for
Bikaner. Twenty-four hours sufficed to seat him on the same
<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>gaddi</em></span> with its prince, and to reveal to him the melancholy fact,
that here he had no hopes of succour. Denied by a branch of
his own house, he resorted to a daring experiment upon the
supporter of his antagonist. The next morning he was on
his way, at the head of his dromedary escort, to the capital
of the Kachhwahas, Jaipur. The “ships of the desert” soon
conveyed him to that city. He halted under the walls, and sent
a messenger to say that in person he had come to solicit his
assistance.</div>

<p class='c001'>Isari Singh, the son and successor of the great Sawai Jai Singh,
had neither the talents of his father, nor even the firmness which
was the common inheritance [756] of his race. He dreaded the
rival Rathor; and the pusillanimity which made him become
the assassin of the father, prompted him to a breach of the sacred
laws of hospitality (which, with courage, is a virtue almost inseparable
from a Rajput soul), and make a captive of the son.
But the base design was defeated by an instance of devotion and
resolution, which will serve to relieve the Rajput character from
the dark shades which the faithful historian is sometimes forced
to throw into the picture. Civil war is the parent of every crime,
and severs all ties, moral and political; nor must it be expected
that Rajputana should furnish the exception to a rule, which
applies to all mankind in similar circumstances. The civil wars
of England and France, during the conflicts of the White
and Red Roses, and those of the League, will disclose scenes
which would suffice to dye with the deepest hues an entire
dynasty of the Rajputs. Let such deeds as the following
<span class='pageno' id='Page_872'>872</span>be placed on the virtuous side of the account, and the crimes
on the opposite side be ascribed to the peculiarities of their
condition.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Devotion of the Mertias.</h4>—The devoted sacrifice of Sher Singh,
the chief of the Mertia clan, has already been recorded. When
victory declared against the side he espoused, the victorious
Bakhta Singh resumed the estates of Rian from his line, and
conferred them on a younger branch of the family. Jawan Singh
was the name of the individual, and he was now with the chosen
band of the son of his benefactor, soliciting succour from the king
of the Kachhwahas. He had married the daughter of the chief
of Achrol, one of the great vassals of Jaipur, who was deep in
the confidence of his sovereign, to whom he imparted his design
to seize the person of his guest and suppliant at the interview he
had granted. Aware that such a scheme could not be effected
without bloodshed, the Achrol chieftain, desirous to save his
son-in-law from danger, under an oath of secrecy revealed the
plot, in order that he might secure himself. The Jaipur prince
came to the ‘Travellers’ hall’ (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>dharmsala</em></span>), where the Rathor
had alighted; they embraced with cordiality, and seated themselves
on the same <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>gaddi</em></span> together. While compliments were yet
passing, the faithful Mertia, who, true to his pledge, had not
even hinted to his master the danger that threatened him, placed
himself immediately behind the Jaipur prince, sitting, as if
accidentally, on the flowing skirt of his robe. The Raja, turning
round to the leader of “the first of the swords of Maru,” remarked
“Why, Thakur, have you taken a seat in the background to-day?”
“The day requires it, Maharaja” [757], was the laconic reply:
for the post of the Mertias was the sovereign’s right hand. Turning
to his prince, he said, “Arise, depart, or your life or liberty
is endangered.” Bijai Singh arose, and his treacherous host made
an attempt to follow, but felt his design impeded by the position
the loyal chief had taken on his garment, whose drawn dagger
was already pointed to his heart, where he threatened to sheathe
it if any hindrance was offered to the safe departure of his sovereign,
to whom he coolly said, as the prince left the astonished assembly,
“Send me word when you are mounted.” The brave Bijai Singh
showed himself worthy of his servant, and soon sent to say,
“He now only waited for him”: a message, the import of which
was not understood by the treacherous Kachhwaha. The leader
<span class='pageno' id='Page_873'>873</span>of the Mertias sheathed his dagger—arose—and coming in front
of the Raja, made him a respectful obeisance. The Jaipur prince
could not resist the impulse which such devotion was calculated
to produce; he arose, returned the salutation, and giving vent
to his feelings, observed aloud to his chiefs, “Behold a picture of
fidelity! It is in vain to hope for success against such men
as these.”</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Bijai Singh returns to Nāgor.</h4>—Foiled in all his endeavours,
Bijai Singh had no resource but to regain Nagor, which he effected
with the same celerity as he quitted it. Six months more passed
away in the attempt to reduce Nagor; but though the siege was
fruitless, not so were the efforts of his rival Ram Singh in other
quarters, to whom almost all the country had submitted: Marot,
Parbatsar, Pali, Sojat had received his flag; and besides the
capital and the town he held in person, Jalor, Siwana, and Phalodi
were the only places which had not been reduced. In this
extremity, Bijai Singh listened to an offer to relieve him from
these multiplied difficulties, which, in its consequences, alienated
for ever the brightest gem in the crown of Marwar.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Assassination of Jai Āpa Sindhia, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1759.</h4>—A Rajput
and an Afghan, both foot-soldiers on a small monthly pay,
offered, if their families were provided for, to sacrifice themselves
for his safety by the assassination of the Mahratta commander.
Assuming the garb of camp-settlers, they approached the headquarters,
feigning a violent quarrel. The simple Mahratta chief
was performing his ablutions at the door of his tent, and as
they approached they became more vociferous, and throwing a
bundle of statements of account on the ground, begged he would
decide between them. In this manner they came nearer and
nearer, and as he listened to their story, one plunged his dagger in
his side, exclaiming, “This for Nagor!” and “This for Jodhpur!”
said his companion [758], as he repeated the mortal blow. The
alarm was given; the Afghan was slain; but the Rajput called
out “Thief!” and mingling with the throng, escaped by a drain
into the town of Nagor.<a id='r4.28.24' /><a href='#f4.28.24' class='c013'><sup>[24]</sup></a> Though the crime was rewarded, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_874'>874</span>Rathor refused to see the criminal. The siege continued, but in
spite of every precaution, reinforcements both of men and provisions
continued to be supplied. It ill suited the restless Mahratta
to waste his time in these desert regions, which could be
employed so much more profitably on richer lands: a compromise
ensued, in which the cause of Ram Singh was abandoned, on
stipulating for a fixed triennial tribute, and the surrender of the
important fortress and district of Ajmer in full sovereignty to
the Mahratta, in <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>mundkati</em></span>, or compensation for the blood of Jai
Apa. The monsoon was then approaching; they broke up,
and took possession of this important conquest, which, placed
in the very heart of these regions, may be called the key of
Rajputana.</div>

<p class='c001'>The cross of St. George now waves over the battlements of
Ajmer,<a id='r4.28.25' /><a href='#f4.28.25' class='c013'><sup>[25]</sup></a> planted, if there is any truth in political declarations,
not for the purpose of conquest, or to swell the revenues of British
India, but to guard the liberties and the laws of these ancient
principalities from rapine and disorder. It is to be hoped that
this banner will never be otherwise employed, and that it may
never be execrated by the brave Rajput.</p>

<p class='c001'>The deserted Ram Singh continued to assert his rights with
the same obstinacy by which he lost them; and for which he
staked his life in no less than eighteen encounters against his
uncle and cousin. At length, on the death of Isari Singh of Jaipur,
having lost his main support, he accepted the Marwar share of
the Salt Lake of Sambhar, and Jaipur relinquishing the other half,
he resided there until his death [759].</p>

Sindhia succeeded to the command of the horde led by
his relation, Jai Apa. He had the genius to discover that his
southron horse would never compete with the Rajputs, and he
set about improving that arm to which the Mahrattas finally
owed success. This sagacious chief soon perceived that the
political position of the great States of Rajasthan was most
favourable to his views of establishing his power in this quarter.
They were not only at variance with each other, but, as it has
already appeared, were individually distracted with civil dissensions.
The interference of the Rana of Udaipur had obtained
for his nephew, Madho Singh, the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>gaddi</em></span> of Jaipur; but this
advantage was gained only through the introduction of the
Mahrattas, and the establishment of a tribute, as in Marwar.
This brave people felt the irksomeness of their chains, and wished
to shake them off. Madho Singh’s reign was short; he was
succeeded by Partap, who determined to free himself from this
badge of dependence.<a id='r4.29.1' /><a href='#f4.29.1' class='c013'><sup>[1]</sup></a> Accordingly, when Mahadaji Sindhia
invaded his country, at the head of a powerful army, he called
on the Rathors for aid. The cause was their own; and they
jointly determined to redeem what had been lost. As the bard
of the Rathors observes, they [760] forgot all their just grounds
of offence<a id='r4.29.2' /><a href='#f4.29.2' class='c013'><sup>[2]</sup></a> against the Jaipur court, and sent the flower of their
chivalry under the chieftain of Rian, whose fidelity has been so
recently recorded. At Tonga (the battle is also termed that of
Lalsot), the rival armies encountered. The celebrated Mogul
chiefs, Ismail Beg and Hamdani, added their forces to those of
the combined Rajputs, and gained an entire victory, in which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_876'>876</span>the Rathors had their full share of glory. The noble chief of
Rian formed his Rathor horse into a dense mass, with which he
charged and overwhelmed the flower of Sindhia’s army, composed
of the regulars under the celebrated De Boigne.<a id='r4.29.3' /><a href='#f4.29.3' class='c013'><sup>[3]</sup></a> Sindhia was
driven from the field, and retired to Mathura; for years he did not
recover the severity of this day. The Rathors sent a force under

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Battle of Pātan, June 20, 1790.</h4>—The genius of General
Comte de Boigne ably seconded the energetic Sindhia. A
regular force was equipped, far superior to any hitherto known,
and was led into Rajputana to redeem the disgrace of Tonga.
The warlike Rathors determined not to await the attack within
their own limits, but marched their whole force to the northern
frontier of Jaipur, and formed a junction with the Kachhwahas
at the town of Patan (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>Tuarvati</em></span>).<a id='r4.29.4' /><a href='#f4.29.4' class='c013'><sup>[4]</sup></a> The words of the war-song,
which the inspiring bards repeated as they advanced, are still
current in Marwar; but an unlucky stanza, which a juvenile
Charan had composed after the battle of Tonga, had completely
alienated the Kachhwahas from their supporters, to whom they
could not but acknowledge their inferiority:</div>

<p class='c035'><span class='pageno' id='Page_877'>877</span>This stanza was retained in recollection at the battle of Patan;
and if universal [761] affirmation may be received as proof, it
was the cause of its loss, and with it that of Rajput independence.
National pride was humbled: a private agreement was entered
into between the Mahrattas and Jaipurians, whereby the latter,
on condition of keeping aloof during the fight, were to have their
country secured from devastation. As usual, the Rathors charged
up to the muzzles of De Boigne’s cannon, sweeping all before
them: but receiving no support, they were torn piecemeal by
showers of grape and compelled to abandon the field. Then, it
is recorded, the brave Rathor showed the difference between
fighting on <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>parbhum</em></span>, or ‘foreign land,’ and on his own native
soil. Even the women, it is averred, plundered them of their
horses on this disastrous day; so heart-broken had the traitorous
conduct of their allies rendered them. The Jaipurians paid
dearly for their revenge, and for the couplet which recorded it:</p>

<p class='c001'>When the fatal result of the battle of Patan was communicated
to Raja Bijai Singh, he called a council of all his nobles, at which
the independent branches of his family, the Rajas of Bikaner,
Kishangarh, and Rupnagarh, assisted, for the cause was a common
one. The Raja gave it as his own opinion, that it was better to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_878'>878</span>fulfil the terms of the former treaty, on the murder of Jai Apa,
acknowledge the cancelled tribute, and restore Ajmer, which they
had recovered by a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>coup de main</em></span>. His valorous chieftains opposed
the degrading suggestion, and unanimously recommended that
they should again try the chances of war ere they signed their
humiliation. Their resolution swayed the prince, who issued his
summons to every Rathor in his dominions to assemble under their
Raja’s banner, once more planted on the ensanguined plains of
Merta. A fine army was embodied; not a Rathor who could
wield a sword but brought it for service in the cause of his country;
and full thirty thousand men assembled on the 10th September
1790, determined to efface the recollections of Patan [762].</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Battle of Merta, September 1790 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span></h4>—There was one miscreant
of Rathor race, who aided on this occasion to rivet his country’s
chains, and his name shall be held up to execration—Bahadur
Singh, the chief of Kishangarh. This traitor to his suzerain and
race held, jointly with his brother of Rupnagarh, a domain of two
hundred and ten townships: not a fief emanating from Marwar,
but all by grant from the kings; still they received the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>tika</em></span>, and
acknowledged the supremacy of the head of Jodhpur. The
brothers had quarrelled; Bahadur despoiled his brother of his
share, and being deaf to all offers of mediation, Bijai Singh
marched and re-inducted the oppressed chief into his capital,
Rupnagarh. The fatal day of Patan occurred immediately after;
and Bahadur, burning with revenge, repaired to De Boigne, and
conducted him against his native land. Rupnagarh, it may be
supposed, was his first object, and it will afford a good proof of
the efficiency of the artillery of De Boigne, that he reduced it in
twenty-four hours. Thence he proceeded to Ajmer, which he
invested: and here the proposal was made by the Raja for its
surrender, and for the fulfilment of the former treaty. Mahadaji
in person remained at Ajmer, while his army, led by Lakwa,
Jiwa-dada, Sudasheo Bhao, and other Mahratta leaders of horse,
with the brigades of De Boigne and eighty pieces of cannon,
advanced against the Rathors. The Mahrattas, preceding by
one day’s march the regulars under De Boigne, encamped at
Natria. The Rathor army was drawn out on the plains of Merta,
one flank resting on the village of Dangiwas. Five miles separated
the Rathors from the Mahrattas; De Boigne was yet in the rear,
his guns being deep sunk in the sandy bed of the Luni. Here a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_879'>879</span>golden opportunity was lost, which could never be regained, of
deciding ‘horse to horse’ the claims of supremacy; but the evil
genius of the Rathor again intervened: and as he was the victim
at Patan to the jealousy of the Kachhwaha, so here he became
the martyr to a meaner cause, the household jealousies of the civil
ministers of his prince. It is customary in all the Rajput States,
when the sovereign does not command in person, to send one of
the civil ministers as his representative. Him the feudal chiefs
will obey, but not one of their own body, at least without some
hazard of dissension. Khub Chand Singwi, the first minister,
was present with the Raja at the capital: Gangaram Bhandari
and Bhimraj Singwi were with the army. Eager to efface the
disgrace of Patan, the two great Rathor leaders, Sheo Singh of
Awa, and Mahidas of Asop, who had sworn to free their country
or die in the [763] attempt, demanded a general movement against
the Mahrattas. This gallant impatience was seconded by all the
other nobles, as well as by a successful attack on the foragers of
the enemy, in which the Mahrattas lost all their cattle. But it
was in vain they urged the raging ardour of their clans, the policy
of taking advantage of it, and the absence of De Boigne, owing
to whose admirable corps and well-appointed park the day at
Patan was lost; Bhimraj silenced their clamour for the combat
by producing a paper from the minister Khub Chand commanding
them on their allegiance not to engage until the junction of Ismail
Beg, already at Nagor. They fatally yielded obedience. De
Boigne extricated his guns from the sands of Alniawas, and joined
the main body. That night the Bikaner contingent, perceiving
the state of things, and desirous to husband their resources to
defend their own altars, withdrew. About an hour before day-break,
De Boigne led his brigade to the attack, and completely
surprised the unguarded Rajputs.<a id='r4.29.7' /><a href='#f4.29.7' class='c013'><sup>[7]</sup></a> They were awoke by showers
of grape-shot, which soon broke their position: all was confusion;
the resistance was feeble. It was the camp of the irregular
infantry and guns which broke, and endeavoured to gain Merta;
and the civil commanders took to flight. The alarm reached the
more distant quarters of the brothers-in-arms, the chiefs of Awa
and Asop. The latter was famed for the immense quantity of
opium he consumed; and with difficulty could his companion
awake him, with the appalling tidings, “The camp has fled, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_880'>880</span>we are left alone!” “Well, brother, let us to horse.” Soon the
gallant band of both was ready, and twenty-two chiefs of note
drank opium together for the last time. They were joined by the
leaders of other clans; and first and foremost the brave Mertias
of Rian, of Alniawas, Irwa, Chanod, Govindgarh; in all four
thousand Rathors. When mounted and formed in one dense
mass, the Awa chieftain shortly addressed them: “Where can
we fly, brothers? But can there be a Rathor who has ties stronger
than shame (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>laj</em></span>)? If any one exist who prefers his wife and
children to honour, let him retire.” Deep silence was the only
reply to this heroic appeal; and as the hand of each warrior was
raised to his forehead, the Awa chief gave the word “Forward!”
They soon came up with De Boigne’s brigade, well posted, and
defended by eighty pieces of cannon. “Remember Patan!”
was the cry, as, regardless of showers of grape, this heroic band
charged up to the cannon’s mouth, driving everything before
them, cutting [764] down the line which defended the guns, and
passing on to assault the Mahrattas, who were flying in all directions
to avoid their impetuous valour. Had there been a reserve
at this moment, the day of Merta would have surpassed that of
Tonga. But here the skill of De Boigne, and the discipline of
his troops, were an overmatch for valour unsustained by discipline
and discretion. The Rathor band had no infantry to secure their
victory; the guns were wheeled round, the line was re-formed,
and ready to receive them on their return. Fresh showers of shot
and grape met their thinned ranks; scarcely one of the four
thousand left the field. The chiefs of Asop, Irwa, Chanod,
Govindgarh, Alniawas, Morira, and others of lesser note, were
among the slain; and upon the heaps of wounded, surrounded
by his gallant clan, lay the chief of Awa, pierced with seven-and-twenty
wounds. He had lain insensible twenty-four hours, when
an old servant, during the night, searched for and found him on
the field. A heavy shower had fallen, which increased the
miseries of the wounded. Blind and faint, the Thakur was
dragged out from the bodies of the slain. A little opiate revived
him; and they were carrying him off, when they were encountered
by Lakwa’s harkaras in search of chiefs of note; the wounded
Thakur was conveyed to the headquarters at Merta. Lakwa
sent a surgeon to sew up his wounds; but he disdained the
courtesy, and refused all aid, until the meanest of his wounded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_881'>881</span>vassals was attended to. This brave man, when sufficiently
recovered, refused all solicitation from his sympathizing foes that
the usual rejoicing might be permitted, and that he would shave
and perform the ablutions after sickness, till he could see his
sovereign. The Raja advanced from his capital to meet him,
and lavished encomiums on his conduct. He now took the bath,
preparatory to putting on the honorary dress; but in bathing
his wounds opened afresh, and he expired.</div>

<p class='c001'>Bhimraj Singwi received at Nagor, whither he had fled, a letter
of accusation from his sovereign, on which he swallowed poison;
but although he was indirectly the cause of the defeat, by his
supineness, and subsequent disgraceful flight, it was the minister
at the capital whose treason prevented the destruction of the
Mahrattas: Khub Chand was jealous of Bhimraj; he dreaded
being supplanted by him if he returned from Merta crowned with
success; and he therefore penned the dispatch which paralysed
their energies, enjoining them to await the junction of Ismail
Beg [765].</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus, owing to a scurrilous couplet of a bard, and to the
jealousy of a contemptible court-faction, did the valiant Rathors
lose their independence—if it can be called lost—since each of
these brave men still deems himself a host, when “his hour should
come” to play the hero. Their spirit is not one jot diminished
since the days of Tonga and Merta.<a id='r4.29.8' /><a href='#f4.29.8' class='c013'><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

<div class='section-start'><span class='pageno' id='Page_882'>882</span><h4 class='disp-inline'>British Policy towards the Rajputs.</h4>—By a careful investigation
of the circumstances which placed those brave races in their
present political position, the paramount protecting power may
be enabled to appreciate them, either as allies or as foes; and it
will demonstrate more effectually than mere opinions, from whatever
source, how admirably qualified they are, if divested of
control, to harmonize, in a very important respect, with the
British system of government in the East. We have nothing
to dread from them, individually or collectively; and we may
engage their very hearts’ blood in our cause against whatever foes
may threaten us, foreign or domestic, if we only exert our interference
when mediation will be of advantage to them, without
offence to [766] their prejudices. Nor is there any difficulty in
the task; all honour the peacemaker, and they would court even
arbitration if once assured that we had no ulterior views. But
our strides have been rapid from Calcutta to Rajputana, and it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_883'>883</span>were well if they credit what the old Nestor of India (Zalim Singh
of Kotah) would not, who, in reply to all my asseverations that
we wished for no more territory, said, “I believe you think so;
but the time will come when there will be but one <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>sikka</em></span><a id='r4.29.9' /><a href='#f4.29.9' class='c013'><sup>[9]</sup></a> throughout

was ripe and ready to be eaten, and you had only to take it bit
by bit. It was not your power, so much as our disunion, which
made you sovereigns, and will keep you so.” His reasoning is
not unworthy of attention, though I trust his prophecy may never
be fulfilled.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Jharāu.</h4>—<em>November 28.</em>—Camp at Jharau, five coss (11 miles).
On leaving Merta, we passed over the ground sacred to “the four
thousand,” whose heroic deeds, demonstrating at once the
Rajput’s love of freedom and his claim to it, we have just related.
We this day altered our course from the N.N.E., which would
have carried us, had we pursued it, to the Imperial city, for a
direction to the southward of east, in order to cross our own
Aravalli and gain Ajmer. The road was excellent, the soil very
fair; but though there were symptoms of cultivation near the
villages, the wastes were frightfully predominant; yet they are
not void of vegetation: there is no want of herbage or stunted
shrubs. The Aravalli towered majestically in the distant horizon,
fading from our view towards the south-east, and intercepted by
rising grounds.</div>

<p class='c001'><b>The Mirage.</b>—We had a magnificent mirage this morning: nor
do I ever recollect observing this singularly grand phenomenon
on a more extensive scale, or with greater variety of form. The
morning was desperately cold; the thermometer, as I mounted
my horse, a little after sunrise, stood at 32°, the freezing-point,
with a sharp biting wind from the north-east. The ground was
blanched with frost, and the water-skins, or <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>bihishtis mashaks</em></span>,
were covered with ice at the mouth. The slender shrubs, especially
the milky <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>ak</em></span>, were completely burnt up; and as the weather had
been hitherto mild, the transition was severely felt, by things
animate and inanimate [767].</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_884'>884</span>It is only in the cold season that the mirage is visible; the
sojourners of Maru call it the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>siya-kot</em></span>, or ‘castles in the air.’<a id='r4.29.11' /><a href='#f4.29.11' class='c013'><sup>[11]</sup></a> In
the deep desert to the westward, the herdsmen and travellers
through these regions style it <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>chitram</em></span>, ‘the picture’; while
about the plains of the Chambal and Jumna they term it <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>disasul</em></span>,
‘the omen of the quarter.’ This optical deception has been
noticed from the remotest times. The prophet Isaiah alludes to
it when he says, “and the parched ground shall become a pool”;<a id='r4.29.12' /><a href='#f4.29.12' class='c013'><sup>[12]</sup></a>
which the critic has justly rendered, “and the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>shārāb</em></span>h<a id='r4.29.13' /><a href='#f4.29.13' class='c013'><sup>[13]</sup></a> shall
become real water.” Quintus Curtius, describing the mirage in
the Sogdian desert, says that “for the space of four hundred
furlongs not a drop of water is to be found, and the sun’s heat,
being very vehement in summer, kindles such a fire in the sands,
that everything is burnt up. There also arises such an exhalation,
that the plains wear the appearance of a vast and deep sea”;
which is an exact description of the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>chitram</em></span> of the Indian desert.
But the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>shārābh</em></span> and <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>chitram</em></span>, the true mirage of Isaiah, differ
from that illusion called the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>siya-kot</em></span>; and though the traveller
will hasten to it, in order to obtain a night’s lodging, I do not
think he would expect to slake his thirst there.</p>

<p class='c001'>When we witnessed this phenomenon at first, the eye was
attracted by a lofty opaque wall of lurid smoke, which seemed to
be bounded by, or to rise from, the very verge of the horizon.
By slow degrees the dense mass became more transparent, and
assumed a reflecting or refracting power: shrubs were magnified
into trees; the dwarf <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>khair</em></span> appeared ten times larger than the
gigantic <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>amli</em></span> of the forest. A ray of light suddenly broke the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_885'>885</span>line of continuity of this yet smoky barrier; and, as if touched
by the enchanter’s wand, castles, towers, and trees were seen in
an aggregated cluster, partly obscured by magnificent foliage.
Every accession of light produced a change in the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>chitram</em></span>, which
from the dense wall that it first exhibited had now faded into a
thin transparent film, broken into a thousand masses, each mass
being a huge lens; until at length the [768] too vivid power of
the sun dissolved the vision: castles, towers, and foliage melted,
like the enchantment of Prospero, into “thin air.”</p>

<p class='c001'>I had long imagined that the nature of the soil had some effect
in producing this illusory phenomenon; especially as the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>chitram</em></span>
of the desert is seen chiefly on those extensive plains productive
of the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>sajji</em></span>, or alkaline plant, whence by incineration the natives
produce soda,<a id='r4.29.14' /><a href='#f4.29.14' class='c013'><sup>[14]</sup></a> and whose base is now known to be metallic. But
I have since observed it on every kind of soil. That these lands,
covered with saline incrustations, tend to increase the effect of
the illusion, may be concluded.<a id='r4.29.15' /><a href='#f4.29.15' class='c013'><sup>[15]</sup></a> But the difference between the
<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>sarāb</em></span> or <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>chitram</em></span>, and the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>siya-kot</em></span> or <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>disasul</em></span> is, that the latter is
never visible but in the cold season, when the gross vapours
cannot rise; and that the rarefaction, which gives existence to
the other, destroys this, whenever the sun has attained 20° of
elevation. A high wind is alike adverse to the phenomenon, and
it will mostly be observed that it covets shelter, and its general
appearance is a long line which is sure to be sustained by some
height, such as a grove or village, as if it required support. The
first time I observed it was in the Jaipur country; none of the
party had ever witnessed it in the British provinces. It appeared
like an immense walled town with bastions, nor could we give
credit to our guides, when they talked of the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>siya-kot</em></span>, and assured
us that the objects were merely “castles in the air.” I have
since seen, though but once, this panoramic scene in motion, and
nothing can be imagined more beautiful.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was at Kotah, just as the sun rose, whilst walking on the
terraced roof of the garden-house, my residence. As I looked
towards the low range which bounds the sight to the south-east,
the hills appeared in motion, sweeping with an undulating or
rotatory movement along the horizon. Trees and buildings were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_886'>886</span>magnified, and all seemed a kind of enchantment. Some minutes
elapsed before I could account for this wonder; until I determined
that it must be the masses of a floating mirage, which had
attained its most attenuated form, and being carried by a gentle
current of air past the tops and sides of the hills, while it was itself
imperceptible, made them appear in motion.</p>

<p class='c001'>But although this was novel and pleasing, it wanted the
splendour of the scene of this morning, which I never saw equalled
but once. This occurred at Hissar, where I went to visit a beloved
friend—gone, alas! to a better world [769],—whose ardent
and honourable mind urged me to the task I have undertaken.
It was on the terrace of James Lumsdaine’s house, built amidst
the ruins of the castle of Firoz, in the centre of one extended
waste, where the lion was the sole inhabitant, that I saw the
most perfect specimen of this phenomenon: it was really sublime.
Let the reader fancy himself in the midst of a desert plain, with
nothing to impede the wide scope of vision, his horizon bounded
by a lofty black wall encompassing him on all sides. Let him
watch the first sunbeam break upon this barrier, and at once, as
by a touch of magic, shiver it into a thousand fantastic forms,
leaving a splintered pinnacle in one place, a tower in another, an
arch in a third; these in turn undergoing more than kaleidoscopic
changes, until the “fairy fabric” vanishes. Here it was emphatically
called Harchand Raja ki puri, or ‘the city of Raja
Harchand,’ a celebrated prince of the brazen age of India.<a id='r4.29.16' /><a href='#f4.29.16' class='c013'><sup>[16]</sup></a> The
power of reflection shown by this phenomenon cannot be better
described than by stating that it brought the very ancient
Agroha,<a id='r4.29.17' /><a href='#f4.29.17' class='c013'><sup>[17]</sup></a> which is thirteen miles distant, with its fort and bastions,
close to my view.</p>

<p class='c001'>The difference then between the mirage and the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>siya-kot</em></span> is,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_887'>887</span>that the former exhibits a horizontal, the latter a columnar or
vertical stratification; and in the latter case, likewise, a contrast
to the other, its maximum of translucency is the last stage of its
existence. In this stage, it is only an eye accustomed to the
phenomenon that can perceive it at all. I have passed over the
plains of Meerut with a friend who had been thirty years in India,
and he did not observe a <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>siya-kot</em></span> then before our eyes: in fact
so complete was the illusion, that we only saw the town and fort
considerably nearer. Monge gives a philosophical account of
this phenomenon in Napoleon’s campaign in Egypt; and Dr.
Clarke perfectly describes it in his journey to Rosetta, when
“domes, turrets, and groves were seen reflected on the glowing
surface of the plain, which appeared like a vast lake extending
itself between the city and travellers.” It is on reviewing this
account that a critic has corrected the erroneous translation of
the Septuagint; and further dilated upon it in a review of
Lichtenstein’s travels in Southern Africa,<a id='r4.29.18' /><a href='#f4.29.18' class='c013'><sup>[18]</sup></a> who exactly describes
our <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>siya-kot</em></span>, of the magnifying and reflecting powers of which he
gives a [770] singular instance. Indeed, whoever notices, while
at sea, the atmospheric phenomena of these southern latitudes,
will be struck by the deformity of objects as they pass through
this medium: what the sailors term a fog-bank is the first stage
of our <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>siya-kot</em></span>. I observed it on my voyage home; but more
especially in the passage out. About six o’clock on a dark
evening, while we were dancing on the waste, I perceived a ship
bearing down with full sail upon us so distinctly, that I gave the
alarm, in expectation of a collision; so far as I recollect, the helm
was instantly up, and in a second no ship was to be seen. The
laugh was against me—I had seen the “flying Dutchman,”<a id='r4.29.19' /><a href='#f4.29.19' class='c013'><sup>[19]</sup></a>
according to the opinion of the experienced officer on deck; and
I believed it was really a vision of the mind: but I now feel
convinced it was either the reflection of our own ship in a passing
cloud of this vapour, or a more distant object therein refracted.
But enough of this subject: I will only add, whoever has a desire
to see one of the grandest phenomena in nature, let him repair

<span class='pageno' id='Page_888'>888</span>the fairy palace of Harchand, infinitely grander and more imposing
than a sunrise upon the alpine Helvetia, which alone may
compete with the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>chitram</em></span> of the desert.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Cenotaph of a Thākur.</h4>—Jharau is a thriving village appertaining
to a sub-vassal of the Mertia chief of Rian. There was a
small sheet of water within a musket-shot to the left of the village,
on whose margin, peeping through a few nims and the evergreen
jhal,<a id='r4.29.20' /><a href='#f4.29.20' class='c013'><sup>[20]</sup></a> was erected an elegant, though small <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>chhatri</em></span>, or cenotaph,
of an ancestor of the possessor. The Thakur is sculptured on
his charger, armed at all points; and close beside him, with folded
hands, upon the same stone, his faithful partner, who accompanied
the warrior to Indra’s abode. It bore the following
epitaph: “On the 2d Margsir, S. 1689 (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1633), Maharaja
Jaswant Singh attacked the enemy’s (Aurangzeb’s) army, in
which battle Thakur Harankarna Das, of the Mertia clan, was
slain. To him was erected this shrine, in the month of Margsir,
S. 1697.”</div>

<p class='c001'>Water from wells is about thirty-five cubits from the surface;
the strata as follows: four cubits of mixed sand and black earth;
five of kankar, or calcareous concretions; twenty of stiff clay
and sand; six of indurated clay, with particles of quartz and
mica [771].</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Alniawās.</h4>—<em>November 29.</em>—Alniawas, five coss. Half-way,
passed the town of Rian, so often mentioned as the abode of the
chief of the Mertia clan. It is large and populous, and surrounded
by a well-constructed wall of the calcareous concrete already
described, here called <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>morar</em></span>, and which resists the action of the
monsoon. The works have a most judicious slope. The Thakur’s
name is Badan Singh, one of the eight great barons of Maru.
The town still bears the name of <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>Sher Singh ka Rian</em></span>, who so
gallantly defended to the death the rights of his young sovereign
Ram Singh against his uncle. A beautiful landscape is seen from
the high ground on which the town stands, in the direction of the
mountains; the intermediate space being filled with large villages,
relieved by foliage, so unusual in these regions. Here I had a
proof of the audacity of the mountaineers of the Aravalli, in an
inscription on a cenotaph, which I copied: “On Monday the 3d
Magh, S. 1835 (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1779), Thakur Bhopal Singh fell at the foot
of his walls, defending them against the Mers, having first, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_889'>889</span>his own hand, in order to save her honour, put his wife to death.”<a id='r4.29.21' /><a href='#f4.29.21' class='c013'><sup>[21]</sup></a>
Such were the Mers half a century ago, and they had been increasing
in boldness ever since. There was scarcely a family on
either side the range, whose estates lay at its foot, whose cenotaphs
do not bear similar inscriptions, recording the desperate raids of
these mountaineers; and it may be asserted that one of the
greatest benefits we conferred on Rajputana was the conversion
of this numerous banditti, occupying some hundred towns, into
peaceful, tax-paying subjects. We can say, with the great
Chauhan king, Bisiladeva, whose monument still stands in Firoz’s
palace at Delhi, that we made them “carry water in the streets
of Ajmer”; and, still more, deposit their arms on the Rana’s
terrace at Udaipur. We have, moreover, metamorphosed a
corps of them from breakers, into keepers, of the public peace.</div>

<p class='c001'>Between Rian and Alniawas we crossed a stream, to which the
name of the Luni<a id='r4.29.22' /><a href='#f4.29.22' class='c013'><sup>[22]</sup></a> is also given, as well as to that we passed
subsequently. It was here that De Boigne’s guns are said to have
stuck fast.</p>

<p class='c001'>The soundings of the wells at Rian and Alniawas presented
the same results as [772] at Jharau, with the important exception
that the substratum was steatite, which was so universal in the
first part of my journey from Jodhpur.</p>

<p class='c001'>Alniawas is also a fief of a Mertia vassal. It is a considerable
town, populous, and apparently in easy circumstances. Here
again I observed a trait of devotion, recorded on an altar “to the
memory of Suni Mall,” who fell when his clan was exterminated
in the charge against the rival Champawats, at Merta, in the
civil wars.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Govindgarh.</h4>—<em>November 30.</em>—Govindgarh, distance three coss,
or six miles. The roads generally good, though sometimes heavy;
the soil of a lighter texture than yesterday. The castle and town
of Govinda belong to a feudatory of the Jodha clan; its founder,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_890'>890</span>Govind, was grandson to Udai <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>le gros</em></span>; or, as Akbar dubbed him,
the “Mota Raja,” from his great bulk. Of this clan is the chief
of Khairwa, having sixteen townships in his fief: Banai, and
Masuda, with its “fifty-two townships,” both now in Ajmer;
having for their present suzerain the “Sarkar Company
Bahadur”; though in lapses they will still go to Jodhpur, to be
made “belted knights.” These places are beyond the range;
but Pisangan, with its twelve villages; Bijathal, and other fiefs
west of it, also in Ajmer, might at all events be restored to their
ancient princes, which would be considered as a great boon.
There would be local prepossessions to contend with, on the part
of the British officers in charge of the district; but such objections
must give way to views of general good.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Fox-hunting: Hyaenas.</h4>—This was another desperately cold
morning; being unprovided with a great-coat, I turned the
<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>dagla</em></span>, or ‘quilted brocade tunic,’ sent me by the high priest of
Kanhaiya, to account. We had some capital runs this morning
with the foxes of Maru, which are beautiful little animals, and
larger than those of the provinces. I had a desperate chase after
a hyaena on the banks of the Luni, and had fully the speed of
him; but his topographical knowledge was too much for me,
and he at length led me through a little forest of reeds or rushes,
with which the banks of the river are covered for a great depth.
Just as I was about giving him a spear, in spite of these obstacles,
we came upon a blind nullah or ‘dry rivulet,’ concealed by the
reeds; and Bajraj (the royal steed) was thrown out, with a
wrench in the shoulder, in the attempt to clear it: the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>jhirak</em></span>
laughed at us.</div>

<p class='c001'>We crossed a stream half a mile west of Govindgarh, called
the Sagarmati [773], which, with another, the Sarasvati, joining
it, issues from the Pushkar lake. The Sagarmati is also called
the Luni; its bed is full of micaceous quartzose rock. The
banks are low, and little above the level of the country. Though
water is found at a depth of twelve cubits from the surface, the
wells are all excavated to the depth of forty, as a precautionary
measure against dry seasons. The stratification here was—one
cubit sand; three of sand and soil mixed; fifteen to twenty of
yellow clayish sand; four of morar, and fifteen of steatite and
calcareous concretions, with loose sand, mixed with particles of
quartz.</p>

<div class='section-start'><span class='pageno' id='Page_891'>891</span><h4 class='disp-inline'>Pushkar Lake.</h4>—<em>December 1.</em>—Lake of Pushkar, four coss: the
thermometer stood at the freezing-point this morning:—heavy
sands the whole way. Crossed the Sarasvati near Nand; its
banks were covered with bulrushes, at least ten feet in height—many
vehicles were lading with them for the interior, to be used
for the purposes of thatching—elephants make a feast among
them. We again crossed the Sarasvati, at the entrance of the
valley of Pushkar, which comes from Old (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>burha</em></span>) Pushkar, four
miles east of the present lake, which was excavated by the last
of the Pariharas of Mandor. The sand drifted from the plains
by the currents of air has formed a complete bar at the mouth of
the valley, which is about one mile in breadth; occasionally the
<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>tibas</em></span>, or sand-hills, are of considerable elevation. The summits
of the mountains to the left were sparkling with a deep rose-coloured
quartz, amidst which, on the peak of Nand, arose a
shrine to ‘the Mother.’ The hills preserve the same character:
bold pinnacles, abrupt sides, and surface thinly covered. The
stratification inclines to the west; the dip of the strata is about
twenty degrees. There is, however, a considerable difference in
the colour of the mountains: those on the left have a rose tint;
those on the right are of greyish granite, with masses of white
quartz about their summits.</div>

<p class='c001'>Pushkar is the most sacred lake in India; that of Mansarovar
in Tibet may alone compete with it in this respect. It is placed
in the centre of the valley, which here becomes wider, and affords
abundant space for the numerous shrines and cenotaphs with
which the hopes and fears of the virtuous and the wicked amongst
the magnates of India have studded its margin. It is surrounded
by sand-hills of considerable magnitude, excepting on the east,
where a swamp extends to the very base of the mountains. The
form of the lake may be called an irregular ellipse. Around its
margin, except towards the marshy outlet, is a display of [774]
varied architecture. Every Hindu family of rank has its niche
here, for the purposes of devotional pursuits when they could abstract
themselves from mundane affairs. The most conspicuous
are those erected by Raja Man of Jaipur, Ahalya Bai, the Holkar
queen, Jawahir Mall of Bharatpur, and Bijai Singh of Marwar.
The cenotaphs are also numerous. The ashes of Jai Apa, who
was assassinated at Nagor, are superbly covered; as are those of
his brother Santaji, who was killed during the siege of that place.</p>

<div class='section-start'><span class='pageno' id='Page_892'>892</span><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Brahma Temple.</h4>—By far the most conspicuous edifice is
the shrine of the creator Brahma, erected, about four years ago,
by a private individual, if we may so designate Gokul Parik, the
minister of Sindhia; it cost the sum of 130,000 rupees (about
£15,000), though all the materials were at hand, and labour could
be had for almost nothing. This is the sole tabernacle dedicated
to the <span class='sc'>One God</span> which I ever saw or have heard of in India.<a id='r4.29.23' /><a href='#f4.29.23' class='c013'><sup>[23]</sup></a>
The statue is quadrifrons; and what struck me as not a little
curious was that the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>sikhar</em></span>, or pinnacle of the temple, is surmounted
by a cross. Tradition was here again at work. Before
creation began, Brahma assembled all the celestials on this very
spot, and performed the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>Yajna</em></span>; around the hallowed spot walls
were raised, and sentinels placed to guard it from the intrusion
of the evil spirits. In testimony of the fact, the natives point
out the four isolated mountains, placed towards the cardinal
points, beyond the lake, on which, they assert, rested the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>kanats</em></span>,
or cloth-walls of inclosure. That to the south is called Ratnagir,
or ‘the hill of gems,’ on the summit of which is the shrine of
Savitri. That to the north is Nilagir, or ‘the blue mountain.’
East, and guarding the valley, is the Kuchhaturgir; and to the
west, Sonachaura, or ‘the golden.’ Nandi, the bull-steed of
Mahadeva, was placed at the mouth of the valley, to keep away
the spirits of the desert; while Kanhaiya himself performed this
office to the north. The sacred fire was kindled: but Savitri,
the wife of Brahma, was nowhere to be found, and as without a
female the rites could not proceed, a young Gujari took the place
of Savitri; who, on her return, was so enraged at the indignity,
that she retired to the mountain of gems, where she disappeared.
On this spot a fountain gushed up, still called by her name; close
to which is her shrine, not the least attractive in the precincts
of Pushkar. During these rites, Mahadeva, or, as he is called,
Bholanath, represented always in a state of stupefaction from
the use of intoxicating [775] herbs, omitted to put out the sacred
fire, which spread, and was likely to involve the world in combustion;
when Brahma extinguished it with the sand, and hence
the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>tibas</em></span> of the valley. Such is the origin of the sanctity of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_893'>893</span>Pushkar. In after ages, one of the sovereigns of Mandor, in the
eagerness of the chase, was led to the spot, and washing his hands
in the fountain, was cured of some disorder. That he might
know the place again, he tore his turban into shreds, and suspended
the fragments to the trees, to serve him as guides to the spot—there
he made the excavation. The Brahmans pretend to have
a copper-plate grant from the Parihara prince of the lands about
Pushkar; but I was able to obtain only a Persian translation
of it, which I was heretical enough to disbelieve. I had many
grants brought me, written by various princes and chiefs, making
provision for the prayers of these recluses at their shrines.</div>

<p class='c001'>The name of Bisaladeva, the famed Chauhan king of Ajmer,
is the most conspicuous here; and they still point out the residence
of his great ancestor, Ajaipal, on the Nagpahar, or ‘serpent-rock,’
directly south of the lake, where the remains of the fortress of
the Pali or Shepherd-king are yet visible. Ajaipal was, as his
name implies, a goatherd, whose piety, in supplying one of the
saints of Pushkar with daily libations of goats’ milk, procured
him a territory. Satisfied, however, with the scene of his early
days, he commenced his castle on the serpent-mount; but his
evil genius knocking down in the night what he erected in the
day, he sought out another site on the opposite side of the range:
hence arose the far-famed Ajamer.<a id='r4.29.24' /><a href='#f4.29.24' class='c013'><sup>[24]</sup></a> Manika Rae is the most
conspicuous connecting link of the Chauhan Pali kings, from the
goatherd founder to the famed Bisaladeva.<a id='r4.29.25' /><a href='#f4.29.25' class='c013'><sup>[25]</sup></a> Manika was slain
in the first century of the Hijra, when “the arms of Walid conquered
to the Ganges”; and Bisaladeva headed a confederacy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_894'>894</span>of the Hindu kings, and chased the descendants of Mahmud
from Hindustan, the origin of the recording column at Delhi.
Bisaladeva, it appears from inscriptions, was the contemporary
of Rawal Tejsi, the monarch of Chitor, and grandfather of
the Ulysses of Rajasthan, the brave Samarsi, who fell with
13,000 of his kindred in aid of the last Chauhan Prithiraj,
who, according to the genealogies of this race, is the fourth
in descent from Bisaladeva. If this is not sufficient proof of
the era of this king, be it known that Udayaditya, the prince
of the Pramaras (the period of [776] whose death, or <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>
1096, has now become a datum),<a id='r4.29.26' /><a href='#f4.29.26' class='c013'><sup>[26]</sup></a> is enumerated amongst the
sovereigns who serve under the banners of the Chauhan of
Ajmer.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Bhartrihari.</h4>—The ‘serpent-rock’ is also famed as being one
of the places where the wandering Bhartrihari, prince of Ujjain,
lived for years in penitential devotion; and the slab which served
as a seat to this royal saint has become one of the objects of
veneration. If all the places assigned to this brother of Vikrama
were really visited by him, he must have been one of the greatest
tourists of antiquity, and must have lived to an antediluvian old
age. Witness his castle at Sehwan, on the Indus; his cave at
Alwar; his <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>thans</em></span> at Abu, and at Benares. We must, in fact,
give credit to the couplet of the bards, “the world is the Pramara’s.”
There are many beautiful spots about the serpent-mount, which,
as it abounds in springs, has from the earliest times been the
resort of the Hindu sages, whose caves and hermitages are yet
pointed out, now embellished with gardens and fountains. One
of the latter issuing from a fissure in the rock is sacred to the
Muni Agastya, who performed the very credible exploit of drinking
up the ocean.</div>

<p class='c001'>St. George’s banner waved on a sand-hill in front of the cross
on Brahma’s temple, from which my camp was separated by the
lake; but though there was no defect of legendary lore to amuse
us, we longed to quit “the region of death,” and hie back to our
own lakes, our cutter, and our gardens.</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Ajmer.</b>—<em>December 2.</em>—Ajmer, three coss. Proceeded up the
valley, where lofty barriers on either side, covered with the milky
thor (<em>cactus</em>),<a id='r4.29.27' /><a href='#f4.29.27' class='c013'><sup>[27]</sup></a> and the “yellow anwla of the border,” showed they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_895'>895</span>were but the prolongation of our own Aravalli. Granite appeared
of every hue, but of a stratification so irregular as to bid defiance
to the geologist. The higher we ascended the valley, the loftier
became the sand-hills, which appeared to aspire to the altitude
of their granitic neighbours. A small rill poured down the valley;
there came also a cold blast from the north, which made our
fingers tingle. Suddenly we changed our direction from north
to east, and ascending the mountain, surveyed through a gap
in the range the far-famed Daru-I-Khair. The view which thus
suddenly burst upon us was magnificent. A noble plain, with
trees, and the expansive lake of Bisaladeva, lay at our feet, while
‘the fortress of the goatherd’ crowned the crest of a majestic
isolated hill. The point of descent affords a fine field for the
mineralogist; on [777] each side, high over the pass, rise peaks
of reddish granite, which are discovered half-way down the descent
to be reposing on a blue micaceous slate, whose inclination is
westward, at an angle of about 25° with the horizon. The formation
is the same to the southward, but the slate there is more
compact, and freer from mica and quartz. I picked up a fragment
of black marble; its crystals were large and brilliant.</p>

<p class='c001'>Passed through the city of Ajmer, which, though long a regal
abode, does not display that magnificence we might have expected,
and, like all other towns of India, exhibits poverty and ease in
juxtaposition. It was gratifying to find that the finest part was
rising, under the auspices of the British Government and the
superintendent of the province, Mr. Wilder. The main street,
when finished, will well answer the purpose intended—a place
of traffic for the sons of commerce of Rajasthan, who, in a body,
did me the honour of a visit: they were contented and happy at
the protection they enjoyed in their commercial pursuits. With
the prosperity of Bhilwara, that of Ajmer is materially connected;
and having no interests which can clash, each town views the
welfare of the other as its own: a sentiment which we do not
fail to <a id='corr895.34'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='encourage'>encourage.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_895.34'><ins class='correction' title='encourage'>encourage.</ins></a></span></p>

He did them ample justice, and when I talked of the field of Merta, the

<p class='c001'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Le dix, avant le jour, la brigade reçut l’ordre de marcher en avant, et
elle surprit les Rajepoutes pendant qu’ils faisoient leurs ablutions du matin.
Les premiers bataillons, avec cinquante pièces de canon tirant à mitraille,
enfoncèrent les lignes de l’ennemi et enlevèrent ses positions. Rohan, qui
commandait l’aile droite, à la vue de ce premier avantage, sans avoir reçu
aucun ordre, eut l’imprudence de s’avancer hors de la ligne du combat, à la
tête de trois bataillons. La cavalerie Rathore profitant de cette faute,
fondit à l’instant sur lui et faillit lui couper sa retraite sur le gros de l’armée,
qu’il ne parvint à rejoindre qu’avec les plus grandes difficultés. Toute la
cavalerie ennemie se mit alors en mouvement, et se jetant avec impétuosité
sur la brigade, l’attaqua sur tous les côtés à la fois. Elle eût été infailliblement
exterminée sans la présence d’esprit de son chef. M. de Boigne, s’étant
aperçu de l’erreur commise par son aile droite et prévoyant les suites qu’elle
pouvait entraîner, avait disposé sur-le-champ son infanterie en carré vide
(hollow square); et par cette disposition, présentant partout un front à
l’ennemi, elle opposa une résistance invincible aux charges furieuses des
Rathores, qui furent enfin forcés de lâcher prise. Aussitôt l’infanterie
reprit ses positions, et s’avançant avec son artillerie, elle fit une attaque
générale sur toute la ligne des Rajepoutes. Déjà sur les neuf heures,
l’ennemi était complètement battu; une heure après, les Marhattes prirent
possession de son camp avec tous ses canons et bagages; et pour couronner
cette journée, à trois heures après midi la ville de Mirtah fut prise d’assaut”

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Ajmer.</h4>—Ajmer has been too long the haunt of Moguls and
Pathans, the Goths and Vandals of Rajasthan, to afford much
scope to the researches of the antiquary. Whatever time had
spared of the hallowed relics of old, bigotry has destroyed, or
raised to herself altars of materials, whose sculptured fragments
serve now as disjointed memorials of two distinct and distant
eras: that of the independent Hindu, and that of the conquering
Muhammadan, whose idgahs and mosques, mausoleums and
country-seats, constructed from the wrecks of aboriginal art,
are fast mouldering to decay. The associations they call forth
afford the only motive to wish their preservation; except one
“relic of nobler days and noblest arts,” which, though impressed
with this double character, every spectator must desire to rescue
from the sweeping sentence—the edifice before the reader, a visit to
which excited these reflections. Let us rather bless than execrate
the hand, though it be that of a Turk, which has spared, from
whatever motive, one of the most perfect, as well as the most
ancient, monuments of Hindu architecture. It is built on the
western declivity of the fortress, and called Arhai din ka jhonpra,
or, ‘the shed of two and a half days,’ from its having occupied
(as tradition tells) its magical builders only this short period.
The skill of the Pali or Takshak architect, the three sacred mounts
of these countries abundantly attest: nor had he occasion for
any mysterious arts, besides those of masonry, to accomplish
them. In discussing the cosmogony of the Hindus, we have had
occasion to convert their years into days; here we must reverse
the method, and understand (as in [779] interpreting the sacred
prophecies of Scripture) their days as meaning years. Had it,
indeed, been of more humble pretensions, we might have supposed
the monotheistic Jain had borrowed from the Athenian legislator
Cecrops, who ordained that no tomb should consist of more work
than ten men could finish in three days; to which Demetrius,
the Phalerian, sanctioned the addition of a little vessel to contain
the ghost’s victuals.<a id='r4.30.1' /><a href='#f4.30.1' class='c013'><sup>[1]</sup></a></div>

<p>ANCIENT JAIN TEMPLE AT AJMER.<br /><span class='small'><em>To face page 896.</em></span></p>
</div>
</div>

<div class='section-start'><span class='pageno' id='Page_897'>897</span><h4 class='disp-inline'>Arhāi din ka jhonpra Mosque.</h4>—The temple is surrounded by
a superb screen of Saracenic architecture, having the main front
and gateway to the north. From its simplicity, as well as its
appearance of antiquity, I am inclined to assign the screen to
the first dynasty, the Ghorian sultans, who evidently made use
of native architects. The entrance arch is of that wavy kind,
characteristic of what is termed the Saracenic, whether the term
be applied to the Alhambra of Spain, or the mosques of Delhi;
and I am disposed, on close examination, to pronounce it Hindu.<a id='r4.30.2' /><a href='#f4.30.2' class='c013'><sup>[2]</sup></a>
The entire façade of this noble entrance, which I regret I cannot
have engraved, is covered with Arabic inscriptions. But, unless
my eyes much deceived me, the small frieze over the apex of the
arch contained an inscription in Sanskrit,<a id='r4.30.3' /><a href='#f4.30.3' class='c013'><sup>[3]</sup></a> with which Arabic
has been commingled, both being unintelligible. The remains
of a minaret still maintain their position on the right flank of the
gate, with a door and steps leading to it for the muazzin to call
the faithful to prayers. A line of smaller arches of similar form
composes the front of the screen. The design is chaste and
beautiful, and the material, which is a compact limestone of a
yellow colour, admitting almost of as high a polish as the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>jaune
antique</em></span>, gave abundant scope to the sculptor. After confessing
and admiring the taste of the Vandal architect, we passed under
the arch to examine the more noble production of the Hindu.
Its plan is simple, and consonant with all the more ancient temples
of the Jains. It is an extensive saloon, the ceiling supported by
a quadruple range of columns, those of the centre being surmounted
by a range of vaulted coverings; while the lateral
portion, which is flat, is divided into compartments of the most
elaborate sculpture. But the columns are most worthy of attention;
they are unique in design, and with the exception of the
cave-temples, probably amongst the oldest now existing in India.
On examining them, ideas entirely novel, even in Hindu [780]
<span class='pageno' id='Page_898'>898</span>art, are developed. Like all these portions of Hindu architecture,
their ornaments are very complex, and the observer will not fail
to be struck with their dissimilarity; it was evidently a rule in
the art to make the ornaments of every part unlike the other,
and which I have seen carried to great extent. There may be
forty columns but no two are alike. The ornaments of the base
are peculiar, both as to form and execution; the lozenges, with
the rich tracery surmounting them, might be transferred, not
inappropriately, to the Gothic cathedrals of Europe. The projections
from various parts of the shaft (which on a small scale
may be compared to the corresponding projections of the columns
in the Duomo at Milan), with the small niches still containing the
statues, though occasionally mutilated, of the Pontiffs of the Jains,
give them a character which strengthens the comparison, and
which would be yet more apparent if we could afford to engrave
the details.<a id='r4.30.4' /><a href='#f4.30.4' class='c013'><sup>[4]</sup></a> The elegant Kamakumbha, the emblem of the Hindu
Ceres, with its pendent palmyra-branches, is here lost, as are
many emblematical ornaments, curious in design and elegant
in their execution. Here and there occurs a <a id='corr898.19'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='righly'>richly</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_898.19'><ins class='correction' title='righly'>richly</ins></a></span> carved corbeille,
which still further sustains the analogy between the two systems
of architecture; and the capitals are at once strong and delicate.
The central vault, which is the largest, is constructed after the
same fashion as that described at Nadol; but the concentric
annulets, which in that are plain, in this are one blaze of ornaments,
which with the whole of the ceiling is too elaborate and complicated
for description. Under the most retired of the compartments,
and nearly about the centre, is raised the mimbar, or
pulpit, whence the Mulla enunciates the dogma of Muhammad,
“there is but one God”: and for which he dispossessed the Jain,
whose creed was like his own, the unity of the Godhead. But
this is in unison with the feeling which dictated the external
metamorphosis. The whole is of the same materials as already
described, from the quarries of the Aravalli close at hand, which
are rich in every mineral as well as metallic production:—</div>

<p class='c015'>Shall we abandon them to cold ‘oblivion’; or restore them

Jahan<a id='r4.30.5' /><a href='#f4.30.5' class='c013'><sup>[5]</sup></a> of a period two centuries before the Christian era, and
to whom the shrine in Kumbhalmer is ascribed? Of one thing
there is no doubt, which is, that both are Jain, and of the most
ancient models: and thus advertised, the antiquary will be able
to discriminate between the architectural systems of the Saivas
and the Jains, which are as distinct as their religions.</p>

<p class='c001'>Having alluded to the analogy between the details in the
columns and those in our Gothic buildings (as they are called),
and surmised that the Saracenic arch is of Hindu origin; I may
further, with this temple and screen before us, speculate on the
possibility of its having furnished some hints to the architects
of Europe. It is well known that the Saracenic arch has crept
into many of those structures called Gothic, erected in the twelfth
and thirteenth centuries, when a more florid style succeeded to
the severity of the Saxon or Romans; but I believe it has been
doubted whence the Saracens obtained their model; certainly
it was neither from Egypt nor Persia. The early caliphs of
Baghdad, who were as enlightened as they were powerful, kept
alive the light of science when Europe was in darkness; and
the most accomplished noble who accompanied our C&oelig;ur de Lion,
though “brave as his sword,” was a clown compared to the
infidel Saladin, in mind as well as manners. The influence of
these polished foes on European society it would be superfluous
to descant upon. The lieutenants of these caliphs, who penetrated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_900'>900</span>from the Delta of the Indus to the Ganges from four to
five centuries prior to this event, when Walid’s arms triumphed
simultaneously on the Indus and the Ebro, produced no trifling
results to the arts. This very spot, Ajmer, according to traditional
couplets and the poetic legends of its ancient princes, the
Chauhans, was visited by the first hostile force which Islam sent
across the Indus, and to which Manika Rae fell a sacrifice. What
ideas might not this Jain temple have afforded to [782] “the
Light of Ali,” for Roshan Ali is the name preserved of him who,
“in ships landing at Anjar,” marched through the very heart
of India, and took Garh Bitli, the citadel of Ajmer, by assault.
The period is one of total darkness in the history of India, save
for the scattered and flickering rays which emanate from the
chronicles of the Chauhans and Guhilots. But let us leave the
temple, and slightly describe the castle of Manika Rae, on whose
battlements an infidel’s arrow of Roshan’s army reached the
heir of the Chauhan; since which Lot, for such was his name,
has been adopted amongst the lares and penates of this celebrated
race. This was the first Rajput blood which the arms of conversion
shed, and the impression must have been strong to be thus
handed down to posterity.</p>

<p class='c001'>The mind, after all, retires dissatisfied: with me it might be
from association. Even the gateway, however elegant, is unsuitable
to the genius of the place. Separately considered, they
are each magnificent; together, it is as if a modern sculptor were
(like our actors of the last age) to adorn the head of Cato with
a peruke. I left this precious relic, with a malediction upon all the
spoilers of art—whether the Thane who pillaged Minerva’s portico
at Athens, or the Turk who dilapidated the Jain temple at Ajmer.<a id='r4.30.6' /><a href='#f4.30.6' class='c013'><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

circumference, and besides the beauty it adds to the vale of Ajmer,
it has a source of interest in being the fountain of the Luni, which
pursues its silent course until it unites with the eastern arm of
the Delta of the Indus: the point of outlet is at the northern
angle of the Daulat Bagh, ‘the gardens of wealth,’ built by
Jahangir for his residence when he undertook to conquer the
Rajputs. The water is not unwholesome, and there are three
outlets at this fountainhead for the escape of the water fitting
its periodical altitudes. The stream at its parent source is thence
called the Sagarmati. It takes a sweep northward by Bhaonta
and Pisangan, and close to where we crossed it, at Govindgarh,
it is joined by the Sarasvati from Pushkar; when the united
waters (at whose <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>sangam</em></span>, or confluence, there is a small temple

named the Anasagar, after the grandson of Bisaldeo, who has
left the reputation of great liberality, and a contrast with Visala.
The vestiges of an island are yet seen in the lake, and upon its
margin; but the materials have been carried away by the Goths.
There are two small buildings on the adjacent heights, called
“the annulets of Khwaja Kutb,” and some other saint.</div>

<p class='c001'>Such are the wonders in the environs of Daru-l-Khair, “celebrated
in the history of the Moguls, as well as of the Hindus.”
But my search for inscriptions to corroborate the legends of the
Chauhans proved fruitless. I was, however, fortunate enough to
add to my numismatic treasures some of the currency of these
ancient kings, which give interest to a series of the same description,
all appertaining [784] to the Buddhists or Jains. The
inscription occupying one side is in a most antique character,
the knowledge of which is still a desideratum: the reverse bears
the effigies of a horse, the object of worship to the Indo-Scythic
Rajput.<a id='r4.30.9' /><a href='#f4.30.9' class='c013'><sup>[9]</sup></a> It is not improbable that the Agnikula Chauhan may
have brought these letters with him from higher Asia. Researches
in these countries for such monuments may yet discover how far
this conjecture is correct. At Pushkar I also found some very
ancient coins. Had the antiquary travelled these regions prior
to the reign of Aurangzeb he would have had a noble field to
explore: many coins were destroyed by this bigot, but many
were buried underground, which time or accident may disclose.

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Return March to Udaipur.</h4>—<em>December 5.</em>—At daybreak we left
the towers of Manika Rae, enveloped in mist, and turned our
horses’ heads to the southward, on our return to Udaipur. While
at Ajmer, I received accounts of the death of the prince of Kotah,
and did intend to proceed direct to that capital, by Shahpura
and Bundi; but my presence was desired by the Rana to repair
the dilapidations which only two months’ absence had [785]
occasioned in the political fabric which I had helped to reconstruct.
Other interesting objects intervened: one, a visit to the
new castle of Bhimgarh, erecting in Merwara to overawe the
Mers; the other to compose the feuds which raged between the
sectarian merchants of the new mart, Bhilwara, and which
threatened to destroy all my labour. We made two marches to
Bhinai, in which there was nothing to record. Bhinai is the
residence of a Rathor chieftain, whose position is rather peculiar.
Being placed within the district of Ajmer, and paying an annual
quit-rent to the British, he may consider the Company as his
sovereign; but although this position precludes all political
subordination to the chief of the race, the tie would be felt and
acknowledged, on a lapse, in the anxiety for the usual <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>tika</em></span> of
recognition to his successor, from the Raja of Marwar. I argue
on knowledge of character and customs; though it is possible
this individual case might be against me.</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_904'>904</span>The castle of Bhinai is a picturesque object in these level
plains; it is covered with the cactus, or prickly pear, so abundant
on the east side of the Aravalli. This was anciently the residence
of a branch of the Parihara princes of Mandor, when held as a
fief of the Chauhans of Ajmer; and from it originated a numerous
mixed class, called the Parihara Minas, a mixture of Rajput and
aboriginal blood.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Deolia.</h4>—<em>December 6.</em>—Deolia, near the northern bank of the
Khari, the present boundary of Ajmer and Mewar. From Ajmer
to Deolia the direction of the road is S.S.E., and the distance
forty miles. This important district in the political geography
of Rajputana, which, with the posts of Nimach and Mhow, is
the connecting link between the British dominions on the Jumna
and in the Deccan, was obtained by cession from Sindhia in 1818.
A glance at the map is sufficient to show its importance in our
existing connexion with Rajputana. The greatest breadth of
the district is between the Aravalli west and the Banas east,
and measures about eight miles. The greatest length is between
the city of Ajmer and Jhak, a post in Merwara, measuring about
forty miles. The narrowest portion is that where we now are,
Deolia, whence the Kishangarh frontier can be seen over a neck
of land of about twelve miles in extent. Within these bounds
a great portion of the land is held by feudal chieftains paying a
quit-rent, which I believe is fixed. I had to settle a frontier dispute
at Deolia, regarding the right of cultivating in the bed of the
Khari, which produces very good melons. The soil of Ajmer
cannot [786] be called rich, and is better adapted for the lighter
than the richer grains. Marks of war and rapine were visible
throughout.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Dābla.</h4>—<em>December 7.</em>—This town was a sub-fee of Banera;
but the vassal, a Rathor, had learned habits of insubordination
during Mahratta influence, which he could not or would not throw
aside. In these he was further encouraged by his connexion by
marriage with the old ruler of Kotah, who had exemplified his
hostility to the Dabla vassal’s liege lord by besieging his castle
of Banera. Having so long disobeyed him, his Rajput blood
refused to change with the times; and though he condescended,
at the head of his twenty retainers, to perform homage on stated
days, and take his allotted position in the Banera darbar, he
refused to pay the quit-rent, to which numerous deeds proved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_905'>905</span>his suzerain had a right. Months passed away in ineffectual
remonstrances; it was even proposed that he should hold the
inferior dependencies free of quit-rent, but pay those of Dabla.
All being in vain, the demand was increased to the complete
surrender of Dabla; which elicited a truly Rajput reply: “His
head and Dabla were together.” This obstinacy could not be
tolerated; and he was told that though one would suffice, if
longer withheld both might be required. Like a brave Rathor,
he had defended it for months against a large Mahratta force,
and hence Dabla was vauntingly called “the little Bharatpur.”
Too late he saw his error, but there was no receding; and though
he at length offered a nazarana, through the mediation of the
Kotah wakil, of 20,000 rupees, to obtain the Rana’s investiture,
it was refused and a surrender was insisted on. Being an important
frontier-post, it was retained by the Rana, and compensation
was made to Banera. Every interest was made for him
through the Nestor of Kotah, but in vain; his obstinacy offered
an example too pernicious to admit of the least retrocession, and
Dabla was forthwith incorporated with the appanage of the heir-apparent,
Jawan Singh.</div>

<p class='c001'>Almost the whole of this, the Badnor division, of 360 townships,
is occupied by Rathors, the descendants of those who
accompanied Jaimall to Mewar: the proportion of feudal to
fiscal land therein is as three to one. It is a rich and fertile
tract, and it is to be hoped will maintain in ease and independence
the brave men who inhabit it, and who have a long time been
the sport of rapine.</p>

<p class='c001'>I received a visit from the chief vassal of the Badnor chief,
then at the capital; and as I found it impossible to visit Merwara,
I subsequently deputed Captain [787] Waugh who was hospitably
received and entertained at Badnor. He hunted, and played
the Holi with the old baron, who shows at all times the frankness
of his race: but it being the period of the Saturnalia, he was
especially unreserved; though he was the greatest stickler for
etiquette amongst my many friends, and was always expatiating
on the necessity of attending to the gradations of rank.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Banera.</h4>—<em>December 8.</em>—The castle of Banera is one of the most
imposing feudal edifices of Mewar, and its lord one of the greatest
of its chieftains. He not only bears the title of Raja, but has
all the state-insignia attached thereto. His name happens to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_906'>906</span>be the same as that of his sovereign—his being Raja Bhim, the
prince’s Rana Bhim,—to whom he is nearly related, and but for
blind chance might have been lord of all the Sesodias. It may
be recollected that the chivalrous antagonist of Aurangzeb, the
heroic Rana Raj, had two sons, twins, if we may so term sons
simultaneously born, though by different mothers. The incident
which decided the preference of Jai Singh to Bhim has been
related;<a id='r4.30.13' /><a href='#f4.30.13' class='c013'><sup>[13]</sup></a> the circumstance of the latter’s abandoning his country
to court fortune under the Imperial standard—his leading his
Rajput contingent amongst the mountains of Kandahar—and his
death by dislocation of the spine, through urging his horse at
speed amongst the boughs of a tree. The present incumbent of
Banera is the descendant of that Raja Bhim, who was succeeded
in the honours of his family by his son Suraj, killed whilst heading
his contingent at the storm of Bijapur. The infant son of Suraj
had four districts assigned to him, all taken from his suzerain,
the Rana. In such esteem did the emperor hold the family,
that the son of Suraj was baptized Sultan. He was succeeded
by Sardar Singh, who, on the breaking up of the empire, came
under the allegiance of his rightful sovereign the Rana. Rae
Singh and Hamir Singh complete the chain to my friend Raja
Bhim, who did me the honour to advance two miles from Banera
to welcome and conduct me to his castle. Here I had a good
opportunity of observing the feudal state and manners of these
chiefs within their own domains during a visit of three hours
at Banera. I was, moreover, much attached to Raja Bhim,
who was a perfectly well-bred and courteous gentleman, and
who was quite unreserved with me. From his propinquity to
the reigning family, and from his honours and insignia being the
gift of the king’s, he had been an object of jealousy to the court,
which tended much to retard the restoration [788] of his authority
over his sub-vassals of Banera; the chief of Dabla is one instance
of this. I found little difficulty in banishing the discord between
him and his sovereign, who chiefly complained of the Banera
kettle-drums beating, not only as he entered the city, but as far
as the Porte—the sacred Tripolia; and the use of Chamar<a id='r4.30.14' /><a href='#f4.30.14' class='c013'><sup>[14]</sup></a> in
his presence. It was arranged that these emblems of honour,
emanating from the great foes of Mewar, should never be obtruded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_907'>907</span>on the eye or ear of the Rana; though within his own domain
the Banera chieftain might do as he pleased. This was just;
and Raja Bhim had too much good sense not to conciliate his
“brother and cousin,” Rana Bhim, by such a concession, which
otherwise might have been insisted upon. The estate of Banera
is in value 80,000 rupees of annual rent, one-half of which is in
subinfeudations, his vassals being chiefly Rathors. The only
service performed by Raja Bhim is the contributing a quota for
the commercial mart of Bhilwara, with the usual marks of subordination,
personal duty and homage to the Rana. His estate
is much impoverished from its lying in the very track of the freebooters;
but the soil is excellent, and time will bring hands to
cultivate it, if we exercise a long and patient indulgence.</div>

<p class='c001'>The ‘velvet cushion’ was spread in a balcony projecting
from the main hall of Banera; here the Raja’s vassals were
mustered, and he placed me by his side on the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>gaddi</em></span>. There
was not a point of his rural or domestic economy upon which he
did not descant, and ask my advice, as his “adopted brother.”
I was also made umpire between him and my old friend the baron
of Badnor, regarding a marriage settlement, the granddaughter of
the latter being married to the heir of Banera. I had, besides,
to wade through old grants and deeds to settle the claims between
the Raja and several of his sub-vassals; a long course of disorder
having separated them so much from each other as to
obliterate their respective rights. All these arbitrations were
made without reference to my official situation, but were forced
upon me merely by the claims of friendship; but it was a matter
of exultation to be enabled to make use of my influence for the
adjustment of such disputes, and for restoring individual as well
as general prosperity. My friend prepared his gifts at parting;
I went through the forms of receiving, but waived accepting them:
which may be done without any offence to delicacy. I have been
highly gratified to read the kind reception he gave to the respected
Bishop Heber, in his tour through Mewar. I wonder, however,
that this discerning and elegant-minded man did not [789] notice
the peculiar circumstance of the Raja’s teeth being fixed in with
gold wire, which produces rather an unpleasant articulation.<a id='r4.30.15' /><a href='#f4.30.15' class='c013'><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_908'>908</span>Banera adjoins the estates of the Rathors, and is no great
distance from those of the Sangawats and Jagawats, which lie
at the base of the Aravalli. All require a long period of toleration
and unmolested tranquillity to emerge from their impoverished
condition. My friend accompanied me to my tents,
when I presented to him a pair of pistols, and a telescope with
which he might view his neighbours on the mountains: we
parted with mutual satisfaction, and I believe, mutual regret.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Bhīlwāra.</h4>—<em>December 9.</em>—I encamped about half-a-mile from
<em>our</em> good town of Bhilwara, which was making rapid strides to
prosperity, notwithstanding drawbacks from sectarian feuds;
with which, however, I was so dissatisfied, that I refused every
request to visit the town until such causes of retardation were
removed. I received a deputation from both parties at my tents,
and read them a lecture for their benefit, in which I lamented the
privation of the pleasure of witnessing their unalloyed prosperity.
Although I reconciled them to each other, I would not confide
in their promises until months of improvement should elapse.
They abided by their promise, and I fulfilled mine when the death
of the Bundi prince afforded an opportunity, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>en route</em></span> to that
capital, to visit them. My reception was far too flattering to
describe, even if this were the proper place. The sentiments they
entertained for me had suffered no diminution when Bishop
Heber visited the town. But his informant (one of the merchants),
when he said it ought to have been called Tod-ganj, meant that
it was so intended, and actually received this appellation: but
it was changed, at my request, and on pain of withdrawing my
entire support from it. The Rana, who used to call it himself
in conversation “<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>Tod Sahib ki basti</em></span>,” would have been gratified;
but it would have been wrong to avail myself of his partiality.
In all I was enabled to do, from my friendship, not from my
official character, I always feared the dangers to his independence
from such precedent for interference.<a id='r4.30.16' /><a href='#f4.30.16' class='c013'><sup>[16]</sup></a></div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Māndalgarh.</h4>—<em>December 10.</em>—I deviated from the direct course
<em>homewards</em> (to Udaipur) to visit this beautiful spot, formerly the
head of a flourishing district; but all was dilapidated. The first
revenue derived from Mandal was expended on the repairs of the
dam of its lake, which irrigates a great extent of rice-land. The
Goths had felled [790] most of the fine trees which had ornamented
<span class='pageno' id='Page_909'>909</span>its dam and margin; and several garden-houses, as well as that
on the island in the lake, were in ruins. Not many years ago a
column of victory, said to have been raised by Bisaladeva of Ajmer,
in consequence of a victory over the Guhilots, graced this little
isle. Mandal is now rising from its ruins, and one of the exiles
was so fortunate as to find a vessel containing several pieces of
gold and ornaments, in excavating the ruins of his ancient abode,
though not buried by him. It involved the question of manorial
rights, of which the Rana waived the enforcement, though he
asserted them. To-day I passed between Pansal and Arja, the
former still held by a Saktawat, the latter now united to the fisc.
I have already related the feud between the Saktawats and the
Purawats in the struggle for Arja, which is one of the most compact
castles in Mewar, with a domain of 52,000 bighas, or 12,000
acres, attached to it, rendering it well worth a contest; but the
Saktawat had no right there, say the Purawats; and in fact it is
in the very heart of their lands.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Pur.</h4>—<em>December 11.</em>—This is one of the oldest towns of Mewar,
and if we credit tradition, anterior in date to Vikrama. We
crossed the Kotasari to and from Mandal, passing by the tin and
copper mines of Dariba, and the Purawat estate of Pitawas.
Pur means, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>par eminence</em></span>, ‘the city,’ and anciently the title was
admissible; even now it is one of the chief fiscal towns. It is
in the very heart of the canton, inhabited by the Babas, or
‘infants’ of Mewar, embracing a circle of about twenty-five miles
diameter. The broken chain of mountains, having Banera on
the northern point and Gurla to the south, passes transversely
through this domain, leaving the estate of Bagor, the residence of
Sheodan Singh, west, and extending to the S.E. to Mangrop,
across the Berach. The policy which dictated the establishment
of an isolated portion of the blood-royal of Mewar in the very
centre of the country was wise; for the Babas rarely or ever mix
with the politics of the feudatory chieftains, home or foreign.
They are accordingly entrusted with the command of all garrisons,
and head the feudal quotas as the representative of their sovereign.
They have a particular seat at court, the Baba ka Ol being distinct
from the chieftains’, and in front. Though they inhabit the
lands about Pur, it is not from these they derive their name, but
as descendants from Puru, one of the twenty-five sons of Rana
Udai Singh, that blot in the scutcheon of Mewar [791].</div>

<div class='section-start'><span class='pageno' id='Page_910'>910</span><h4 class='disp-inline'>Garnets.</h4>—About a mile east of Pur there is an isolated hill of
blue slate, in which I found garnets embedded. I have no doubt
persevering adventurers would be rewarded; but though I tried
them with the hammer, I obtained none of any value. They are
also to be obtained on the southern frontier of Kishangarh and
Ajmer, about Sarwar. I received the visits of the ‘infants’ of
Gurla and Gadarmala, both most respectable men, and enjoying
good estates, with strong castles, which I passed the next day.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Rāsmi, on the Banās River.</h4>—<em>December 12.</em>—We had a long
march through the most fertile lands of Mewar, all belonging to
the Rana’s personal domain. The progress towards prosperity
is great; of which Rasmi, the head of a tappa or subdivision of a
district, affords evidence, as well as every village. On our way
we were continually met by peasants with songs of joy, and our
entrance into each village was one of triumph. The Patels and
other rustic officers, surrounded by the ryots, came out of the
villages; while the females collected in groups, with brass vessels
filled with water gracefully resting on their heads, stood at the
entrance, their scarfs half covering their faces, chaunting the
<cite>suhela</cite>; a very ancient custom of the Hindu cultivator on receiving
the superior, and tantamount to an acknowledgment of
supremacy. Whether vanity was flattered, or whether a better
sentiment was awakened, on receiving such tokens of gratitude,
it is not for me to determine: the sight was pleasing, and the
custom was general while I travelled in Mewar. The females
bearing the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>kalas</em></span> on their heads, were everywhere met with.
These were chiefly the wives and daughters of the cultivators,
though not unfrequently those of the Rajput sub-vassals. The
former were seldom very fair, though they had generally fine
eyes and good persons. We met many fragments of antiquity
at Rasmi. Captain Waugh and the doctor were gratified with
angling in the Banas for trout; but as the fish would not rise to
the fly, I set the net, and obtained several dozens: the largest
measured seventeen inches, and weighed seventy rupees, or
nearly two pounds.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Merta.</h4>—<em>December 16.</em>—After an absence of two months we
terminated our circuitous journey, and encamped on the ground
whence we started, all rejoiced at the prospect of again entering
“the happy valley.” We made four marches across the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>duab</em></span>,
watered by the Berach and Banas rivers; the land naturally rich,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_911'>911</span>and formerly boasting some large towns, but as yet only disclosing
the germs of [792] prosperity. There is not a more fertile
tract in India than this, which would alone defray the expenses
of the court if its resources were properly husbanded. But years
must first roll on, and the peasant must meet with encouragement,
and a reduction of taxation to the lowest rate; and the
lord-paramount must alike be indulgent in the exaction of his
tribute. Our camels were the greatest sufferers in the march
through the desert, and one-half were rendered useless. I
received a deputation conveying the Rana’s congratulation on
my return ‘home,’ with a letter full of friendship and importunities
to see me; but the register of the heavens—an oracle
consulted by the Rajput as faithfully as Moore’s Almanack by
the British yeoman—showed an unlucky aspect, and I must
needs halt at Merta, or in the valley, until the signs were more
favourable to a re-entry into Udaipur. Here we amused ourselves
in chalking out the site of our projected residence on the
heights of Tus, and in fishing at the source of the Berach. Of
this scene I present the reader with a view; and if he allows his
imagination to ascend the dam which confines the waters of the
lake, he may view the Udaisagar, with its islets; and directing
his eye across its expanse, he may gain a bird’s-eye view of the
palace of the Kaisar of the Sesodias. The dam thrown across a
gorge of the mountains is of enormous magnitude and strength,
as is necessary, indeed, to shut in a volume of water twelve miles
in circumference. At its base, the point of outlet, is a small
hunting-seat of the Rana’s, going to decay for want of funds to
repair it, like all those on the Tiger Mount and in the valley.
Nor is there any hope that the revenues, burthened as they are
with the payment of a clear fourth in tribute, can supply the
means of preventing further dilapidation.</div>

<p class='c001'><em>December 19.</em>—Tired of two days’ idleness, we passed through
the portals of Debari on our way to Ar, to which place the
Rana signified his intention of advancing in person, to receive
and conduct me ‘home’: an honour as unlooked-for and unsolicited
as it was gratifying. Udaipur presents a most imposing
appearance when approached from the east. The palace of the
Rana, and that of the heir-apparent, the great temple, and the
houses of the nobles, with their turrets and cupolas rising in airy
elegance, afford a pleasing contrast with the heavy wall and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_912'>912</span>pierced battlements of the city beneath. This wall is more
extensive than solid. To remedy this want of strength, a chain
of fortresses has [793] been constructed, about gunshot from it,
commanding every road leading thereto, which adds greatly to
the effect of the landscape. These castellated heights contain
places of recreation, one of which belongs to Salumbar; but all
wear the same aspect of decay.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Ahār.</h4>—Ar, or Ahar,<a id='r4.30.17' /><a href='#f4.30.17' class='c013'><sup>[17]</sup></a> near which we encamped, is sacred to the
manes of the princes of Udaipur, and contains the cenotaphs of
all her kings since the valley became their residence; but as they
do not disdain association, either in life or death, with their
vassals, Ar presents the appearance of a thickly crowded cemetery,
in which the mausoleums of the Ranas stand pre-eminent in “the
place of great faith.”<a id='r4.30.18' /><a href='#f4.30.18' class='c013'><sup>[18]</sup></a> The renowned Amra Singh’s is the most

handsome columns raised on lofty terraces, the architraves of
enormous single blocks, all of white marble, from the quarries of
Kankroli. There are some smaller tombs of a singularly elaborate
character, and of an antiquity which decides the claims of Ar to
be considered as the remains of a very ancient city. The ground
is strewed with the wrecks of monuments and old temples, which
have been used in erecting the sepulchres of the Ranas. The
great city was the residence of their ancestors, and is said to have
been founded by Asaditya upon the site of the still more ancient
capital of Tambavatinagari, where dwelt the Tuar ancestors of
Vikramaditya, before he obtained Avinti, or Ujjain. From
Tambavatinagari its name was changed to Anandpur, ‘the happy
city,’ and at length to Ahar, which gave the patronymic to the
Guhilot race, namely, Aharya. The vestiges of immense mounds
still remain to the eastward, called the Dhul-kot, or ‘fort,’
destroyed by ‘ashes’ (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>dhul</em></span>) of a volcanic eruption. Whether the
lakes of the valley owe their origin to the same cause which is
said to have destroyed the ancient Ahar, a more skilful geologist
must determine. The chief road from the city is cut through this
mound; and as I had observed fragments of sculpture and
pottery on the excavated sides, I commenced a regular opening
of the mound in search of medals, and obtained a few with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_913'>913</span>effigies of an animal, which I fancied to be a lion, but others the
<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>gadha</em></span>, or ass, attributed to Gandharvasen, the brother of Vikrama,
who placed this impress on his coins, the reason of which is given
in a long legend.<a id='r4.30.19' /><a href='#f4.30.19' class='c013'><sup>[19]</sup></a> My impious intentions were soon checked by
some designing knaves about the Rana, and I would not offend
[794] superstition. But the most superficial observer will pronounce
Ar to have been an ancient and extensive city, the walls
which enclose this sepulchral abode being evidently built with
the sculptured fragments of temples. Some shrines, chiefly Jain,
are still standing, though in the last stage of dilapidation, and
they have been erected from the ruins of shrines still older, as
appears from the motley decorations, where statues and images
are inserted with their heads reversed, and Mahavira and Mahadeva
come into actual contact: all are in white marble. Two
inscriptions were obtained; one very long and complete, in the
nail-headed character of the Jains; but their interpretation is
yet a desideratum. A topographical map of this curious valley
would prove interesting, and for this I have sufficient materials.
The Teli-ki-Sarai would not be omitted in such a map, as adding
another to the many instances I have met with, among this industrious
class, to benefit their fellow-citizens. The ‘Oilman’s
Caravanserai’ is not conspicuous for magnitude; but it is remarkable,
not merely for its utility, but even for its elegance of
design. It is equi-distant from each of the lakes. The Teli-ka-Pul,
or ‘Oilman’s Bridge,’ at Nurabad, is, however, a magnificent
memorial of the trade, and deserves preservation; and as I shall
not be able now to describe the region (Gwalior) where it stands,
across the Asan, I will substitute it for the Sarai, of which I have
no memorial.<a id='r4.30.20' /><a href='#f4.30.20' class='c013'><sup>[20]</sup></a> These Telis (oilmen) perambulate the country
<span class='pageno' id='Page_914'>914</span>with skins of oil on a bullock, and from hard-earned pence erect
the structures which bear their name. India owes much to
individual munificence.</div>

<p class='c001'>The planets were adverse to my happy conjunction with the
Sun of the Hindus: and it was determined that I should pass
another day amongst the tombs of Ahar; but I invoked upon
my own devoted head all the evil consequences, as in this case I
was the only person who was threatened. To render this opposition
to the decree less noxious, it was agreed that I should make
my <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>entrée</em></span> by the southern, not by the eastern porte, that of the
sun. The Rana came, attended by his son, his chiefs, his
ministers, and, in fact, all the capital in his train. The most
hearty welcomes were lavished upon us all. “<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>Rama! Rama!
Tod Sahib!</em></span>” (the Hindu greeting) resounded from a thousand
throats, while I addressed each chief by name. It was not a
meeting of formality, but of well-cemented friendship. My
companions, Captain Waugh and Dr. Duncan, were busy interchanging
smiles and cordial greetings, when the Rana, requesting
our presence at the palace next day [795], bade us adieu. He
took the direct road to his palace, while we, to avoid evil spirits,
made a detour by the southern portal, to gain our residence, the
garden of Rampiyari.</p>

of Kotah.</p>

<p class='c012'>May the Jit’ha be thy protector! What does this Jit’h
resemble? which is the vessel of conveyance across the waters
<span class='pageno' id='Page_915'>915</span>of life, which is partly white, partly red? Again, what does it

<p class='c001'>The fame of <span class='sc'>Raja Jit</span> I now shall tell, by whose valour the
lands of <span class='sc'>Salpoora</span> <a id='r4.a1.2' /><a href='#n4.a1.2'>(2)</a> are preserved. The fortunes of Raja Jit
are as flames of fire devouring his foe. The mighty warrior <span class='sc'>Jit
Salindra</span> <a href='#n4.a1.2'>(2)</a> is beautiful in person, and from the strength of his
arm esteemed the first amongst the tribes of the mighty; make
resplendent, as does the moon the earth, the dominions of <span class='sc'>Salpoori</span>.
The whole world praises the <span class='sc'>Jit</span> prince, who enlarges the
renown of his race, sitting in the midst of haughty warriors, like
the lotos in the waters, the moon of the sons of men. The foreheads
of the princes of the earth worship the toe of his foot.
Beams of light irradiate his countenance, issuing from the gems
of his arms of strength. Radiant is his array; his riches abundant;
his mind generous and profound as the ocean. Such is he
of <span class='sc'>Sarya</span> <a id='r4.a1.3' /><a href='#n4.a1.3'>(3)</a> race, a tribe renowned amongst the tribes of the
mighty, whose princes were ever foes to treachery, to whom the
earth surrendered her fruits, and who added the lands of their
foes to their own. By sacrifice, the mind of this lord of men has
been purified; fair are his territories, and fair is the <span class='sc'>Fortress

wrath is the reaper of the field of combat; but to his dependents
he is as the pearl on the neck; who makes no account of the
battle, though streams of blood run through the field. As does
the silver lotos bend its head before the fierce rays of the sun, so
does his foe stoop to him, while the cowards abandon the field [796].</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_916'>916</span><a id='n4.a1.1' /><a href='#r4.a1.1'><i>Note 1</i>.</a>—In the prologue to this valuable relic, which superficially
viewed would appear a string of puerilities, we have conveyed
in mystic allegory the mythological origin of the Jit or
Gete race. From the members of the chief of the gods <span class='sc'>Iswara</span>
or Mahadeva, <em>the god of battle</em>, many races claim birth: the
warrior from his arms; the Charun from his spine; the prophetic
Bhat (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>Vates</em></span>) from his tongue; and the Gete or Jit derive theirs
from his tiara, which, formed of his own hair, is called <i>Jit’ha</i>.
In this tiara, serpents, emblematic of <span class='sc'>Time</span> (kal) and <span class='sc'>Destruction</span>,
are wreathed; also implicative that the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>Jits</em></span>, who are of
<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>Takshac</em></span>, or the serpent race, are thereby protected. The “roaring
flood” which descends from this <i>Jit’ha</i> is the river goddess,
Ganga, daughter of Mena, wife of Iswara. The mixed colour of
his hair, which is partly white, partly of reddish (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>panduranga</em></span>)
hue, arises from his character of <span class='sc'>Ard’hnari</span>, or Hermaphroditus.
All these characteristics of the god of war must have been brought
by the Scythic Gete from the Jaxartes, where they worshipped
him as the Sun (<i>Balnat’h</i>) and as <span class='sc'>Xamolscis</span> (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>Yama</em></span>, vulg. <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>Jama</em></span>)
the infernal divinity.</p>

<p class='c001'>The 12th chapter of the Edda, in describing <span class='sc'>Balder</span> the second
son of Odin, particularly dwells on the beauty of his hair, whence
“the <em>whitest of all vegetables is called the eyebrow of Balder, on the
columns of whose temples there are verses engraved, capable of recalling
the dead to life</em>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>How perfectly in unison is all this of the Jits of Jutland and
the Jits of Rajast’han. In each case the hair is the chief object
of admiration; of Balnath as Balder, and the magical effect of
the Runes is not more powerful than that attached by the chief
of the Scalds of our Gete prince at the end of this inscription,
fresh evidences in support of my hypothesis, that many of the
Rajpoot races and Scandinavians have a common origin—that
origin, Central Asia.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='n4.a1.2' /><a href='#r4.a1.2'><i>Note 2</i>.</a>—Salpoora is the name of the capital of this Jit
prince, and his epithet of Sal-indra is merely titular, as the Indra,
or lord of Sal-poori, ‘the city of Sal,’ which the fortunate discovery
of an inscription raised by Komarpal, king of Anhulwarra
(<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>Nehrwalla</em></span> of D’Anville), dated S. 1207, has enabled me to place
“at the base of the Sewaluk Mountains.” In order to elucidate
this point, and to give the full value to this record of the Jit
princes of the Punjab, I append (No. V.) a translation of the Nehrwalla
conqueror’s inscription, which will prove beyond a doubt
that these <span class='sc'>Jit</span> princes of <span class='sc'>Salpoori</span> in the <em>Punjab</em> were the leaders
of that very colony of the Yuti from the Jaxartes, who in the
fifth century, as recorded by De Guignes, crossed the Indus and
possessed themselves of the Punjab; and strange to say, have
again risen to power, for the Sikhs (<em>disciples</em>) of Nanuk are almost
all of Jit origin.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='n4.a1.3' /><a href='#r4.a1.3'><i>Note 3</i>.</a>—Here this Jit is called of <span class='sc'>Sarya Sac’ha</span>, <em>branch</em> or

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_918'>918</span>Pure in mind, strong in arm, and beloved by mankind, such
was <span class='sc'>Chandrasen</span> <a id='r4.30.a2.5' /><a href='#n4.30.a2.5'>(5)</a>. How shall he be described, who broke
the strength of his foe, on whom when his sword swims in fight,
he appears like a magician. With his subjects he interchanged
the merchandise of liberality, of which he reaped the fruits.
From him whose history is fair, was born <span class='sc'>Kritika</span>, the deeds
of whose arm were buds of renown, forming a necklace of praise
in the eyes of mankind. His queen was dear to him as his own
existence—how can she be described? As the flame is inseparable
from the fire, so was she from her lord—she was the light issuing
from the sun—her name <span class='sc'>Goon-newasa</span> <a id='r4.30.a2.6' /><a href='#n4.30.a2.6'>(6)</a>, and her actions
corresponded with her name. By her he had two sons, like gems
set in bracelets, born to please mankind. The eldest was named
<span class='sc'>Sookunda</span>, the younger <span class='sc'>Deruka</span>. Their fortunes consumed
their foes: but their dependents enjoyed happiness. As the
flowers of Calp-vricsha are beloved by the gods, so are these
brothers by their subjects, granting their requests, and increasing
the glory of the race, whence they sprung.—[A useless descriptive
stanza left out <a id='r4.30.a2.7' /><a href='#n4.30.a2.7'>(7)</a>.]</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Deruka</span> had a son, <span class='sc'>Kuhla</span>, and his was <span class='sc'>Dhunika</span>, whose
deeds ascended high—who could fathom the intentions of mankind—whose

expelled from their mountains and forests the <span class='sc'>Meena</span>
tribes, leaving them no refuge in the three wolds, levelling their
retreats to the ground. His quiver was filled with crescent-formed
arrows—his sword the climber (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>vela</em></span>) <a id='r4.30.a2.8' /><a href='#n4.30.a2.8'>(8)</a>, of which pearls

minds of beholders, over whose expanse the varied feathered

ocean of battle, even to where the Ganges pours in her flood <a id='r4.30.a3.8' /><a href='#n4.30.a3.8'>(8)</a>
did he go, whose abode is <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>Avanti</em></span> <a id='r4.30.a3.9' /><a href='#n4.30.a3.9'>(9)</a>. With faces resplendent
as the moon, on whose lips yet marked with the wound of their
husband’s teeth, the captive wives of his foes, even in their
hearts does Raja Bheem dwell. By his arm he removed the
apprehensions of his enemies; he considered them as errors to
be expunged. He appeared as if created of fire. He could
instruct even the navigator <a id='r4.30.a3.10' /><a href='#n4.30.a3.10'>(10)</a> of the ocean.</p>

<p class='c001'>From him was descended <span class='sc'>Raja Bhoj</span> <a id='r4.30.a3.11' /><a href='#n4.30.a3.11'>(11)</a>. How shall he be

the elephant’s head, the pearl from whose brain <a id='r4.30.a3.12' /><a href='#n4.30.a3.12'>(12)</a> now adorns
his breast; who devours his foe as does <span class='sc'>Rahoo</span> <a id='r4.30.a3.13' /><a href='#n4.30.a3.13'>(13)</a> the sun or
moon, who to the verge of space erected edifices in token of
victory?</p>

<p class='c001'>From him was a son whose name was <span class='sc'>Maun</span>, who was surcharged
with good qualities, and with whom fortune took up her
abode. One day he met an aged man: his appearance made him

spirit which did inhabit it was like the seed of the scented <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>Kadama</em></span> <a id='r4.30.a3.14' /><a href='#n4.30.a3.14'>(14)</a>;
that the riches of royalty were brittle as a blade of grass;
and that man was like a lamp exposed in the light of day. Thus
ruminating, for the sake of his race who had gone before him,
and for the sake of good works, he made this lake, whose waters
are expansive and depth unfathomable. When I look on this
ocean-like lake, I ask myself, if it may not be this which is destined
to cause the final doom <a id='r4.30.a3.15' /><a href='#n4.30.a3.15'>(15)</a>.</p>

the gifts of fortune. When the head is inclined on his lotos foot,
the grain of sand which adheres becomes an ornament thereto.
Such is the lake, shaded with trees, frequented by birds, which
the man of fortune, <span class='sc'>Sriman Raja Maun</span>, with great labour formed.
By the name of its lord (<em>Maun</em>), that of the lake (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>surwur</em></span>) is known

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Etymology of Mārwār.</h4>—Marwar is a corruption of Maruwar,
classically Marusthali or Marusthan, ‘the region of death.’ It
is also called Marudesa, whence the unintelligible Mardes of the
early Muhammadan writers. The bards frequently style it
Mordhar, which is synonymous with Marudesa, or, when it suits
their rhyme, simply Maru. Though now restricted to the
country subject to the Rathor race, its ancient and appropriate
application comprehended the entire ‘desert,’ from the Sutlej
to the ocean.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Rāthors.</h4>—A concise genealogical sketch of the Rathor
rulers of Marwar has already been given;<a id='r5.1.1' /><a href='#f5.1.1' class='c013'><sup>[1]</sup></a> we shall therefore
briefly pass over those times “when a genealogical tree would
strike root in any soil”; when the ambition of the Rathors,
whose branches (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>sakha</em></span>) spread rapidly over ‘the region of death,’
was easily gratified with a solar [2] pedigree. As it is desirable,
however, to record their own opinions regarding their origin, we
shall make extracts from the chronicles (hereafter enumerated),
instead of fusing the whole into one mass, as in the Annals of
Mewar. The reader will occasionally be presented with simple
translations of whatever is most interesting in the Rathor records.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Authorities.</h4>—Let us begin with a statement of the author’s
authorities; first, a genealogical roll of the Rathors, furnished
by a Yati, or Jain priest, from the temple of Narlai.<a id='r5.1.2' /><a href='#f5.1.2' class='c013'><sup>[2]</sup></a> This roll
<span class='pageno' id='Page_930'>930</span>is about fifty feet in length, commencing, as usual, with a theogony,
followed by the production of the ‘first Rathor from the spine
(<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>rahat</em></span>) of Indra,’<a id='r5.1.3' /><a href='#f5.1.3' class='c013'><sup>[3]</sup></a> the nominal father being ‘Yavanaswa, prince
of Parlipur.’ Of the topography of Parlipur, the Rathors have
no other notion than that it was in the north; but in the declared
race of their progenitor, a Yavan prince, of the Aswa or Asi tribe,<a id='r5.1.4' /><a href='#f5.1.4' class='c013'><sup>[4]</sup></a>
we have a proof of the Scythic origin of this Rajput family.</div>

<p class='c001'>The chronicle proceeds with the foundation of Kanyakubja,<a id='r5.1.5' /><a href='#f5.1.5' class='c013'><sup>[5]</sup></a>
or Kanauj, and the origin of Kama-dhwaja<a id='r5.1.6' /><a href='#f5.1.6' class='c013'><sup>[6]</sup></a> (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>vulgo</em></span> Kamdhuj),
the titular appellation of its princes, and concludes with the
thirteen great Sakha, or ramifications of the Rathors, and their
Gotracharya, or genealogical creed.<a id='r5.1.7' /><a href='#f5.1.7' class='c013'><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Another roll, of considerable antiquity, commences in the
fabulous age, with a long string of names, without facts; its sole
value consists in the esteem in which the tribe holds it. We may
omit all that precedes Nain Pal, who, in the year S. 526 (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 470<a id='r5.1.8' /><a href='#f5.1.8' class='c013'><sup>[8]</sup></a>),
conquered Kanauj, slaying its monarch Ajaipal; from which
period the race was termed Kanaujia Rathor. The genealogy
proceeds to Jaichand, the last monarch of Kanauj; relates the
emigration of his nephew Siahji, or Sivaji, and his establishment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_931'>931</span>in the desert (Maruwar), with a handful of his brethren (a wreck
of the mighty kingdom of Kanauj); and terminates with the
death of Raja Jaswant Singh in S. 1735 (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1679), describing
every branch and scion, until we see them spreading over
Maru [3].</p>

<p class='c001'>Genealogy ceases to be an uninteresting pursuit when it
enables us to mark the progress of animal vegetation, from the
germ to the complete development of the tree, until the land is
overshadowed with its branches; and bare as is the chronicle to
the moralist or historian, it exhibits to the observer of the powers
of the animal economy, data which the annals of no other people
on earth can furnish. In <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1193 we see the throne of Jaichand
overturned; his nephew, with a handful of retainers, taking
service with a petty chieftain in the Indian desert. In less than
four centuries we find the descendants of these exiles of the
Ganges occupying nearly the whole of the desert; having founded
three capitals, studded the land with the castles of its feudality,
and bringing into the field fifty thousand men, <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>ek bap ka beta</em></span>,
‘the sons of one father,’ to combat the emperor of Delhi. What
a contrast does their unnoticed growth present to that of the
Islamite conquerors of Kanauj, of whom five dynasties passed
away in ignorance of the renovated existence of the Rathor,
until the ambition of Sher Shah brought him into contact with
the descendants of Siahji, whose valour caused him to exclaim
“he had nearly lost the crown of India for a handful of barley,”
in allusion to the poverty of their land!<a id='r5.1.9' /><a href='#f5.1.9' class='c013'><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>What a sensation does it not excite when we know that a
sentiment of kindred pervades every individual of this immense
affiliated body, who can point out, in the great tree, the branch
of his origin, whilst not one is too remote from the main stem to
forget its pristine connexion with it! The moral sympathies
created by such a system pass unheeded by the chronicler, who
must deem it futile to describe what all sensibly feel, and which
renders his page, albeit little more than a string of names, one of
paramount interest to the ‘sons of Siahji.’</p>

<p class='c001'>The third authority is the Suraj Prakas (Surya Prakasa),
composed by the bard Karnidhan, during the reign and by
command of Raja Abhai Singh. This poetic history, comprised
in 7500 stanzas, was copied from the original manuscript, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_932'>932</span>sent to me by Raja Man, in the year 1820.<a id='r5.1.10' /><a href='#f5.1.10' class='c013'><sup>[10]</sup></a> As usual, the Kavya
(bard) commences with the origin of all things, tracing the
Rathors from the creation down to Sumitra; from whence is a
blank until he recommences with the name of Kamdhuj, which
appears to have been the title assumed by Nain Pal, on his
conquest of Kanauj. Although Karnidhan must have taken his
facts from the [4] royal records, they correspond very well with
the roll from Narlai. The bard is, however, in a great hurry to
bring the founder of the Rathors into Marwar, and slurs over the
defeat and death of Jaichand. Nor does he dwell long on his
descendants, though he enumerates them all, and points out the
leading events until he reaches the reign of Jaswant Singh,
grandfather of Abhai Singh, who “commanded the bard to write
the Suraj Prakas.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The next authority is the Raj Rupak Akhyat, or ‘the royal
relations.’ This work commences with a short account of the
Suryavansa, from their cradle at Ajodhya; then takes up Siahji’s
migration, and in the same strain as the preceding work, rapidly
passes over all events until the death of Raja Jaswant; but it
becomes a perfect chronicle of events during the minority of his
successor Ajit, his eventful reign, and that of Abhai Singh, to the
conclusion of the war against Sarbuland Khan, viceroy of Gujarat.
Throwing aside the meagre historical introduction, it is professedly
a chronicle of the events from S. 1735 (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1679) to S. 1787 (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span>
1734), the period to which the Suraj Prakas is brought down.</p>

<p class='c001'>A portion of the Bijai Vilas, a poem of 100,000 couplets, also
fell into my hands: it chiefly relates to the reign of the prince
whose name it bears, Bijai Singh, the son of Bakhta Singh. It
details the civil wars waged by Bijai Singh and his cousin Ram
Singh (son of Abhai Singh), and the consequent introduction of
the Mahrattas into Marwar.</p>

<p class='c001'>From a biographical work named simply Khyat, or ‘Story,’ I
obtained that portion which relates to the lives of Raja Udai
Singh, the friend of Akbar; his son Raja Gaj, and grandson
Jaswant Singh. These sketches exhibit in true colours the
character of the Rathors.</p>

<p class='c001'>Besides these, I caused to be drawn up by an intelligent man,
who had passed his life in office at Jodhpur, a memoir of transactions
from the death of Ajit Singh, in <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1629, down to the treaty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_933'>933</span>with the English Government in <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1818. The ancestors of the
narrator had filled offices of trust in the State, and he was a living
chronicle both of the past and present.</p>

<p class='c001'>From these sources, from conversations with the reigning
sovereign, his nobles, his ambassadors, and subjects, materials
were collected for this sketch of the Rathors—barren, indeed, of
events at first, but redundant of them as we advance.</p>

<p class='c001'>A genealogical table of the Rathors is added, showing the grand
offsets, whose [5] descendants constitute the feudal frèrage of the
present day. A glance at this table will show the claims of each
house; and in its present distracted condition, owing to civil
broils, will enable the paramount power to mediate, when necessary,
with impartiality, in the conflicting claims of the prince and
his feudatories.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Rāthor Origins.</h4>—We shall not attempt to solve the question,
whether the Rathors are, or are not, Ravi-vansa, ‘Children of
the Sun’; nor shall we dispute either the birth or etymon of the
first Rathor (from the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>rahat</em></span> or spine of Indra), or search in the
north for the kingdom of the nominal father; but be content to
conclude that this celestial interference in the household concerns
of the Parlipur prince was invented to cover some disgrace. The
name of Yavana, with the adjunct Aswa or Asi, clearly indicates
the Indo-Scythic ‘barbarian’ from beyond the Indus. In the
genealogy of the Lunar races descended of Budha and Ila (Mercury
and the Earth—see <a id='corr933.25'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Not reprinted'>Table I. Vol. I.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_933.25'><ins class='correction' title='Not reprinted'>Table I. Vol. I.</ins></a></span>), the five sons of Bajaswa are
made to people the countries on and beyond the Indus; and in
the scanty records of Alexander’s invasion mention is made of
many races, as the Assasenae and Assakenoi, still dwelling in these
regions.</div>

<p class='c001'>This period was fruitful in change to the old-established
dynasties of the Hindu continent, when numerous races of
barbarians, namely, Huns, Parthians, and Getae, had fixed
colonies on her western and northern frontiers.<a id='r5.1.11' /><a href='#f5.1.11' class='c013'><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>“In S. 526 (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 470) Nain Pal obtained Kanauj, from which

from the conquest of Kanauj [7] by Nain Pal, in <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 470, and the
establishment of his thirteen grandsons in divers countries, until
we reach Jaichand, in whose person (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1193) terminated the
Rathor sovereignty on the Ganges; and we have only twenty-one
names to fill up the space of seven centuries, although the
testimony on which it is given<a id='r5.1.23' /><a href='#f5.1.23' class='c013'><sup>[23]</sup></a> asserts there were twenty-one
princes bearing the title of Rao prior to the assumption of that
of Raja. But the important information is omitted as to who
was the first to assume this title. There are names in the Yati’s
roll that are not in the Suraj Prakas, which we have followed;
and one of these, Rangatdhwaj, is said to have overcome Jasraj
Tuar, king of Delhi, for whose period we have correct data: yet
we cannot incorporate the names in the Yati’s roll with that just
given without vitiating each; and as we have no facts, it is useless
to perplex ourselves with a barren genealogy. But we can assert
that it must have been a splendid dynasty, and that their actions,
from the conqueror Nain Pal to the last prince, Jaichand, were
well deserving of commemoration. That they were commemorated
in written records there cannot be a doubt; for the
trade of the bardic chroniclers in India has flourished in all
ages.</div>

<div class='section-start'><span class='pageno' id='Page_936'>936</span><h4 class='disp-inline'>The City of Kanauj.</h4>—Although we have abundant authority
to assert the grandeur of the kingdom of Kanauj<a id='r5.1.24' /><a href='#f5.1.24' class='c013'><sup>[24]</sup></a> at the period
of its extinction, both from the bard Chand and the concurrent
testimony of Muhammadan authors, yet are we astonished at the
description of the capital, attested not only by the annals of the
Rathors, but by those of their antagonists, the Chauhans.</div>

<p class='c001'>The circumvallation of Kanauj covered a space of more than
thirty miles; and its numerous forces obtained for its prince the
epithet of ‘Dal Pangla,’ meaning that the mighty host (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>Dal</em></span>) was
lame or had a halt in its movements owing to its numbers, of
which Chand observes that in the march “the van had reached
their ground ere the rear had moved off.” The Suraj Prakas
gives the amount of this army, which in numbers might compete
with the most potent which, in ancient or modern times, was ever
sent into the field. “Eighty thousand men in armour; thirty
thousand horse covered with <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>pakhar</em></span>, or quilted mail; three
hundred thousand Paiks or infantry; and of bow-men and battle-axes
two hundred thousand; besides a cloud of elephants bearing
warriors” [8].</p>

<p class='c001'>This immense army was to oppose the Yavana beyond the
Indus; for, as the chronicle says, “The king of Gor and Irak
crossed the Attock. There Jai Singh met the conflict, when the
Nilab changed its name to Surkhab.<a id='r5.1.25' /><a href='#f5.1.25' class='c013'><sup>[25]</sup></a> There was the Ethiopic

by the lord of Kanauj.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The chronicles of the Chauhans, the sworn foe of the Rathors,
repeat the greatness of the monarch of Kanauj, and give him the
title of “Mandalika.”<a id='r5.1.27' /><a href='#f5.1.27' class='c013'><sup>[27]</sup></a> They affirm that he overcame the king
of the north,<a id='r5.1.28' /><a href='#f5.1.28' class='c013'><sup>[28]</sup></a> making eight tributary kings prisoners; that he
twice defeated Siddhraj, king of Anhilwara, and extended his
dominions south of the Nerbudda, and that at length, in the fulness
of his pride, he had divine honours paid him in the rite Swayamvara.<a id='r5.1.29' /><a href='#f5.1.29' class='c013'><sup>[29]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_937'>937</span>This distinction, which involves the most august ceremony,
and is held as a virtual assumption of universal supremacy,
had in all ages been attended with disaster. In the rite of
Swayamvara every office, down to the scullion of the Rasora,
or banquet-hall, must be performed by royal personages; nor
had it been attempted by any of the dynasties which ruled India
since the Pandu: not even Vikrama, though he introduced his
own era, had the audacity to attempt what the Rathor determined
to execute. All India was agitated by the accounts of the
magnificence of the preparations, and circular invitations were
despatched to every prince, inviting him to assist at the pompous
ceremony, which was to conclude with the nuptials of the raja’s
only daughter, who, according to the customs of those days,
would select her future lord from the assembled chivalry of India.
The Chauhan bard describes the revelry and magnificence of the
scene: the splendour of the Yajnasala, or ‘hall of sacrifice,’
surpassing all powers of description; in which were assembled
all the princes of India, “save the lord of the Chauhans, and
Samara of Mewar,” who, scorning this assumption of supremacy,
Jaichand made their effigies in gold, assigning to them the most
servile posts; that of the king of the Chauhans being Poliya, or
‘porter of the hall.’ Prithiraj, whose life was one succession of feats
of arms and gallantry, had a double motive for action—love and
revenge. He determined to enjoy both, or perish in the attempt;
“to spoil the sacrifice and bear away the fair of Kanauj from its
halls, though beset [9] by all the heroes of Hind.” The details of
this exploit form the most spirited of the sixty-nine books of the
bard. The Chauhan executed his purpose, and, with the élite of the
warriors of Delhi, bore off the princess in open day from Kanauj. A
desperate running-fight of five days took place. To use the words of
the bard, “he preserved his prize; he gained immortal renown,
but he lost the sinews of Delhi.” So did Jaichand those of Kanauj;
and each, who had singly repelled all attacks of the kings, fell in
turn a prey to the Ghori Sultan,<a id='r5.1.30' /><a href='#f5.1.30' class='c013'><sup>[30]</sup></a> who skilfully availed himself of
these international feuds, to make a permanent conquest of
India.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Great States of North India.</h4>—We may here briefly describe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_938'>938</span>the state of Hindustan at this epoch, and for centuries previous
to the invasions of Mahmud.</div>

<p class='c001'>There were four great kingdoms, namely—</p>
 <ul class='ul_1 c000'>
    <li>1. Delhi, under the Tuars and Chauhans.
    </li>
    <li>2. Kanauj, under the Rathors.
    </li>
    <li>3. Mewar, under the Guhilots.
    </li>
    <li>4. Anhilwara, under the Chauras and Solankis.
    </li>
  </ul>

<p class='c015'>To one or other of these States the numerous petty princes of
India paid homage and feudal service. The boundary between
Delhi and Kanauj was the Kalinadi, or ‘black stream’; the
Kalindi of the Greek geographers.<a id='r5.1.31' /><a href='#f5.1.31' class='c013'><sup>[31]</sup></a> Delhi claimed supremacy
over all the countries westward to the Indus, embracing the lands
watered by its arms, from the foot of the Himalaya,—the desert—to
the Aravalli chain. The Chauhan king, successor to the
Tuars, enumerated one hundred and eight great vassals, many of
whom were subordinate princes.</p>

<p class='c001'>The power of Kanauj extended north to the foot of the Snowy
mountains; eastward to Kasi (Benares); and across the Chambal
to the lands of the Chandel (now Bundelkhand); on the south its
possessions came in contact with Mewar.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mewar, or Madhyawar, the ‘central region,’<a id='r5.1.32' /><a href='#f5.1.32' class='c013'><sup>[32]</sup></a> was bounded to
the north by the Aravalli, to the south by the Pramaras of Dhar
(dependent on Kanauj), and westward by Anhilwara, which State
was bounded by the ocean to the south, the Indus on the west,
and the desert to the north.</p>

<p class='c001'>There are records of great wars amongst all these princes. The
Chauhans and Guhilots, whose dominions were contiguous, were
generally allies, and the Rathors and Tuars (predecessors of the
Chauhans), who were only divided by the Kalinadi, often dyed it
with their blood. Yet this warfare was never of an [10] exterminating
kind; a marriage quenched a feud, and they remained
friends until some new cause of strife arose.</p>

<p class='c001'>If, at the period preceding Mahmud, the traveller had journeyed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_939'>939</span>through the courts of Europe, and taken the line of route, in
subsequent ages pursued by Timur, by Byzantium, through
Ghazni (adorned with the spoils of India), to Delhi, Kanauj, and
Anhilwara, how superior in all that constitutes civilization would
the Rajput princes have appeared to him!—in arts immeasurably
so; in arms by no means inferior. At that epoch, in the west,
as in the east, every State was governed on feudal principles.
Happily for Europe, the democratical principle gained admittance,
and imparted a new character to her institutions; while the third
estate of India, indeed of Asia, remained permanently excluded
from all share in the government which was supported by its
labour, every pursuit but that of arms being deemed ignoble.
To this cause, and the endless wars which feudality engendered,
Rajput nationality fell a victim when attacked by the means at
command of the despotic kings of the north.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Invasion of Shihābu-d-dīn.</h4>—Shihabu-d-din, king of Ghor,

encountered Prithiraj, the Chauhan king of Delhi, the outwork
and bulwark of India, which fell. Shihabu-d-din then attacked
Jaichand, who was weakened by the previous struggle. Kanauj
put forth all her strength, but in vain; and her monarch was the
last son of “the Yavana of Parlipur” who ruled on the banks of

drowned in the sacred stream in attempting to escape.<a id='r5.1.33' /><a href='#f5.1.33' class='c013'><sup>[33]</sup></a></div>

<p class='c001'>This event happened in S. 1249 (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1193), from which period
the overgrown, gorgeous Kanauj ceased to be a Hindu city, when
the “thirty-six races” of vassal princes, from the Himalaya to
the Vindhya, who served under the banners of Bardai Sena,<a id='r5.1.34' /><a href='#f5.1.34' class='c013'><sup>[34]</sup></a>
retired to their patrimonial estates. But though the Rathor
name ceased to exist on the shores of the Ganges, destiny decreed
that a scion should be preserved, to produce in a less favoured
land a long line of kings; that in thirty-one generations his
descendant, Raja Man, “Raj, Rajeswara,” ‘the king, the lord of
kings,’ should be as vainglorious of the sceptre of Maru as either
Jaichand when he commanded divine honours, or his still more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_940'>940</span>remote ancestor Nain Pal fourteen [11] centuries before, when he
erected his throne in Kanauj. The Rathor may well boast of his
pedigree, when he can trace it through a period of 1360 years, in
lineal descent from male to male; and contented with this, may
leave to the mystic page of the bard, or the interpolated pages of
the Puranas, the period preceding Nain Pal.</p>

recruited from Gurjara and other foreign tribes. The tale of the origin of
the Rāthors from Kanauj is a myth, as the dynasty of that place belonged
to the Gahadvāla or Gaharwār clan. The object of the story was to affiliate

<h3 class='c024'>CHAPTER 2</h3>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Migration of the Rāthors into Rājputāna.</h4>—In S. 1268 (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span>
1212), eighteen years subsequent to the overthrow of Kanauj,
Siahji and Setram, grandsons of its last monarch, abandoned the
land of their birth, and with two hundred retainers, the wreck of
their vassalage, journeyed westward to the desert, with the intent,
according to some of the chronicles, of making a pilgrimage to the
shrine of Dwarka;<a id='r5.2.1' /><a href='#f5.2.1' class='c013'><sup>[1]</sup></a> but according to others, and with more
probability, to carve their fortunes in fresh fields, unscathed by
the luxuries in which they had been tried, and proud in their
poverty and sole heritage, the glory of Kanauj [12].</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Tribes of Rājputāna.</h4>—Let us rapidly sketch the geography
of the tribes over whom it was destined these emigrants of the
Ganges should obtain the mastery, from the Jumna to the Indus,
and the Gara River to the Aravalli hills. First, on the east, the
Kachhwahas, under Malesi, whose father, Rao Pajun, was killed
in the war of Kanauj. Ajmer, Sambhar, and the best lands of
the Chauhans fell rapidly to the Islamite—though the strongholds
of the Aravalli yet sheltered some, and Nadol continued for a
century more to be governed by a descendant of Bisaldeo. Mansi,
Rana of the Indha<a id='r5.2.2' /><a href='#f5.2.2' class='c013'><sup>[2]</sup></a> tribe, a branch of the Parihars, still held
<span class='pageno' id='Page_941'>941</span>Mandor, and the various Bhumias around paid him a feudal
subjection as the first chief of the desert. Northward, about
Nagor, lived the community of the Mohils (a name now extinct),
whose chief place was Aurint, on which depended 1440 villages.
The whole of the tracts now occupied by Bikaner to Bhatner were
partitioned into petty republics of Getae or Jats, whose history
will hereafter be related. Thence to the Gara River, the Johyas,
Dahyas, Kathis, Langahas, and other tribes whose names are
now obliterated, partly by the sword, partly by conversion to
Islamism. The Bhattis had for centuries been established within
the bounds they still inhabit, and little expected that this handful
of Rathors was destined to contract them. The Sodha princes
adjoined the Bhattis south, and the Jarejas occupied the valley
of the Indus and Cutch. The Solankis intervened between them
and the Pramaras of Abu and Chandravati, which completed the
chain by junction with Nadol. Various chieftains of the more
ancient races, leading a life of fearless independence, acknowledging
an occasional submission to their more powerful neighbours,
were scattered throughout this space; such as the Dabhis of
Idar and Mewa; the Gohils of Kherdhar; the Deoras of Sanchor;
and Sonigiras of Jalor; the Mohils of Aurint; the Sankhlas of
Sandli, etc.; all of whom have either had their birthright seized
by the Rathor, or the few who have survived and yet retain them
are enrolled amongst their allodial vassals.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Exploits of Siāhji.</h4>—The first exploit of Siahji was at
Kulumad (twenty miles west of the city of Bikaner, not then in
existence), the residence of a chieftain of the Solanki tribe. He
received the royal emigrants with kindness, and the latter repaid
it by the offer of their services to combat his enemy, the Jareja
chieftain of Phulra, well known in all the annals of the period,
from the Sutlej to the ocean, as Lakha Phulani, the most celebrated
riever of Maru, whose castle of Phulra stood amidst the
almost inaccessible [13] sandhills of the desert. By this timely
succour the Solanki gained a victory over Lakha, but with the
loss of Setram and several of his band. In gratitude for this
service, the Solanki bestowed upon Siahji his sister in marriage,
with an ample dower; and he continued his route by Anhilwara
Patan, where he was hospitably entertained by its prince, to the
shrine of Dwarka. It was the good fortune of Siahji again to
encounter Lakha, whose wandering habits had brought him on a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_942'>942</span>foray into the territory of Anhilwara. Besides the love of glory
and the ambition of maintaining the reputation of his race, he
had the stimulus of revenge, and that of a brother’s blood. He
was successful, though he lost a nephew, slaying Lakha in single
combat, which magnified his fame in all these regions, of which
Phulani was the scourge.</div>

<p class='c001'>Flushed with success, we hear nothing of the completion of
Siahji’s pilgrimage; but obedient to the axiom of the Rajput,
“get land,” we find him on the banks of the Luni, exterminating,
at a feast, the Dabhis of Mewa,<a id='r5.2.3' /><a href='#f5.2.3' class='c013'><sup>[3]</sup></a> and soon after the Gohils of
Kherdhar,<a id='r5.2.4' /><a href='#f5.2.4' class='c013'><sup>[4]</sup></a> whose chief, Maheshdas, fell by the sword of the
grandson of Jaichand. Here, in the “land of Kher,” amidst the
sandhills of the Luni (the salt-river of the desert), from which the
Gohils were expelled, Siahji planted the standard of the Rathors.</p>

<p class='c001'>At this period a community of Brahmans held the city and
extensive lands about Pali, from which they were termed Paliwal;<a id='r5.2.5' /><a href='#f5.2.5' class='c013'><sup>[5]</sup></a>
and being greatly harassed by the incursions of the mountaineers,
the Mers and Minas, they called in the aid of Siahji’s band, which
readily undertook and executed the task of rescuing the Brahmans
from their depredations. Aware that they would be renewed,
they offered Siahji lands to settle amongst them, which were
readily accepted; and here he had a son by the Solankani, to
whom he gave the name of Asvatthama. With her, it is recorded,
the suggestion originated to make himself lord of Pali; and it
affords another example of the disregard of the early Rajputs for
the sacred order, that on the Holi, or Saturnalia, he found an
opportunity to “obtain land,” putting to death the heads of this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_943'>943</span>community, and adding the district to his conquests [14]. Siahji
outlived his treachery only twelve months, leaving his acquisitions
as a nucleus for further additions to his children. He had three
sons, Asvatthama, Soning, and Ajmall.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Asvatthāma.</h4>—One of the chronicles asserts that it was Asvatthama,
the successor of Siahji, who conquered “the land of Kher”
from the Gohils. By the same species of treachery by which his
father attained Pali, he lent his aid to establish his brother Soning
in Idar. This small principality, on the frontiers of Gujarat,
then appertained, as did Mewa, to the Dabhi race; and it was
during the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>matam</em></span>, or period of mourning for one of its princes,
that the young Rathor chose to obtain a new settlement. His
descendants are distinguished as the Hathundia<a id='r5.2.6' /><a href='#f5.2.6' class='c013'><sup>[6]</sup></a> Rathors. The
third brother, Aja, carried his forays as far as the extremity of
the Saurashtra peninsula, where he decapitated Bikamsi, the
Chawara chieftain of Okhamandala,<a id='r5.2.7' /><a href='#f5.2.7' class='c013'><sup>[7]</sup></a> and established himself.
From this act his branch became known as the ‘Vadhel’;<a id='r5.2.8' /><a href='#f5.2.8' class='c013'><sup>[8]</sup></a>
and the Vadhels are still in considerable number in that furthest
track of ancient Hinduism called the “World’s End.”</div>

<p class='c001'>Asvatthama died, leaving eight sons, who became the heads
of clans, namely, Duhar, Jopsi, Khampsao, Bhopsu, Dhandhal,
Jethmall, Bandar, and Uhar; of which, four, Duhar, Dhandhal,
Jethmall, and Uhar, are yet known.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Duhar or Dhūhada.</h4>—Duhar succeeded Asvatthama. He
made an unsuccessful effort to recover Kanauj; and then
attempted to wrest Mandor from the Parihars, but “watered
their lands with his blood.” He left seven sons, namely, Raepal,
Kiratpal, Behar, Pital, Jugel, Dalu, and Begar.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Rāēpāl, Chhada, Thīda, Salkha, Biramdeo, Chonda.</h4>—Raepal
succeeded, and revenged the death of his father, slaying the
Parihar of Mandor, of which he even obtained temporary possession.
He had a progeny of thirteen sons, who rapidly spread
their issue over these regions. He was succeeded by his son
Kanhal [or Kānpāl], whose successor was his son Jalhan; he was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_944'>944</span>succeeded by his son Chhada, whose successor was his son Thida.
All these carried on a desperate warfare with, and made conquests
from, their neighbours. Chhada and Thida are mentioned
as very troublesome neighbours in the annals of the Bhattis of
Jaisalmer, who were compelled to carry the war against them
into the “land of Kher.” Rao Thida took the rich district of
Bhinmal from the Sonigira, and made other additions to his
territory from the Deoras and Balechas [15]. He was succeeded
by Salakh or Salkha. His issue, the Salkhawats, now Bhumias,
are yet numerous both in Mewa and Rardara. Salkha was
succeeded by his son Biramdeo, who attacked the Johyas of the
north, and fell in battle. His descendants, styled Biramot and
Bijawat, from another son Bija, are numerous at Setru, Siwana,
and Dechu. Biramdeo was succeeded by his son Chonda, an
important name in the annals of the Rathors. Hitherto they
had attracted notice by their valour and their raids, whenever
there was a prospect of success; but they had so multiplied in
eleven generations that they now essayed a higher flight. Collecting
all the branches bearing the name of Rathor, Chonda assaulted
Mandor, slew the Parihar prince, and planted the banners of
Kanauj on the ancient capital of Maru.</div>

<p class='c001'>So fluctuating are the fortunes of the daring Rajput, ever
courting distinction and coveting <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>bhum</em></span>, ‘land,’ that but a short
time before this success, Chonda had been expelled from all the
lands acquired by his ancestors, and was indebted to the hospitality
of a bard of the Charan tribe, at Kalu; and they yet
circulate the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>kabit</em></span>, or quatrain, made by him when, in the days
of his greatness, he came and was refused admittance to “the
lord of Mandor”; he took post under the balcony, and improvized
a stanza, reminding him of the Charan of Kalu: “<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>Chonda
nahīn āwē chit, Khichar Kalu tanna? Bhup bhaya bhay-bhit,
Mandawar ra mālya?</em></span>” “Does not Chonda remember the
porridge of Kalu, now that the lord of the land looks so terrific
from his balcony of Mandawar?” Once established in Mandor,
he ventured to assault the imperial garrison of Nagor. Here he
was also successful. Thence he carried his arms south, and
placed his garrison in Nadol, the capital of the province of Godwar.
He married a daughter of the Parihar prince,<a id='r5.2.9' /><a href='#f5.2.9' class='c013'><sup>[9]</sup></a> who had the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_945'>945</span>satisfaction to see his grandson succeed to the throne of Mandor.
Chonda was blessed with a progeny of fourteen sons, growing up
to manhood around him. Their names were Ranmall,<a id='r5.2.10' /><a href='#f5.2.10' class='c013'><sup>[10]</sup></a> Satta,
Randhir, Aranyakanwal,<a id='r5.2.11' /><a href='#f5.2.11' class='c013'><sup>[11]</sup></a> Punja, Bhim, Kana, Ajo, Ramdeo,
Bija, Sahasmall, Bagh, Lumba, Seoraj.</p>

<p class='c001'>Chonda had also one daughter named Hansa, married to Lakha
Rana of Mewar [16], whose son was the celebrated Kumbha. It
was this marriage which caused that interference in the affairs of
Mewar, which had such fatal results to both States.<a id='r5.2.12' /><a href='#f5.2.12' class='c013'><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The feud between his fourth son, Aranyakanwal, and the
Bhatti prince of Pugal, being deemed singularly illustrative of
the Rajput character, has been extracted from the annals of
Jaisalmer, in another part of this work.<a id='r5.2.13' /><a href='#f5.2.13' class='c013'><sup>[13]</sup></a> The Rathor chronicler
does not enter into details, but merely states the result, as ultimately
involving the death of Chonda—simply that “he was
slain at Nagor with one thousand Rajputs”; and it is to the
chronicles of Jaisalmer we are indebted for our knowledge of
the manner. Chonda acceded in S. 1438 (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1382), and was
slain in S. 1465 [<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1408-9].</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Ranmall killed <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1444.</h4>—Ranmall succeeded. His mother
was of the Gohil tribe. In stature he was almost gigantic, and
was the most athletic of all the athletes of his nation. With the
death of Chonda, Nagor was again lost to the Rathors. Rana
Lakha presented Ranmall with the township of Darla and forty
villages upon his sister’s marriage, when he almost resided at
Chitor, and was considered by the Rana as the first of his chiefs.
With the forces of Mewar added to his own, under pretence of
conveying a daughter to the viceroy of Ajmer, he introduced his
adherents into that renowned fortress, the ancient capital of the
Chauhans, putting the garrison to the sword, and thus restored
it to Mewar. Khemsi Pancholi, the adviser of this measure, was

<p class='c001'>The bard seldom intrudes the relation of civil affairs into his
page, and when he does, it is incidentally. It would be folly to
suppose that the princes of Maru had no legislative recorders;
but with these the poet had no bond of union. He, however,
condescends to inform us of an important measure of Rao Ranmall,
namely, that he equalized the weights and measures throughout
his dominions, which he divided as at present. The last act of
Ranmall, in treacherously attempting to usurp the throne of the
infant Rana of Mewar, was deservedly punished, and he was
slain by the faithful Chonda, as related in the annals of that
State.<a id='r5.2.15' /><a href='#f5.2.15' class='c013'><sup>[15]</sup></a> This feud originated the line of demarcation of the two

when Marwar at length touched the Aravalli. Rao Ranmall left
twenty-four sons, whose issue, and that of his eldest son, Jodha,
form the great vassalage of Marwar. For this reason, however
barren is a mere catalogue of names, it is of the utmost
value to those who desire to see the growth of the frèrage of such
a community.<a id='r5.2.17' /><a href='#f5.2.17' class='c013'><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c024'>CHAPTER 3</h3>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Jodha, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1444-88. The Foundation of Jodhpur.</h4>—Jodha
was born at Danla, the appanage of his father in Mewar, in the
month Baisakh, S. 1484. In 1511 he obtained Sojat, and in the
month Jeth, 1515 (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1459) laid the foundation of Jodhpur,
to which he transferred the seat of government from Mandor.
With the superstitious Rajput, as with the ancient Roman [19],
every event being decided by the omen or the augur, it would be
contrary to rule if so important an occasion as the change of
capital, and that of an infant State, were not marked by some
propitious prestige, that would justify the abandonment of a
city won by the sword, and which had been for ages the capital
of Maru. The intervention, in this instance, was of a simple
<span class='pageno' id='Page_948'>948</span>nature; neither the flight of birds, the lion’s lair, or celestial
manifestation; but the ordinance of an anchorite, whose abode,
apart from mankind, was a cleft of the mountains of Bakharchiriya.
But the behests of such ascetics are secondary only to
those of the divinity, whose organs they are deemed. Like the
Druids of the Celts, the Vanaprastha Jogi,<a id='r5.3.1' /><a href='#f5.3.1' class='c013'><sup>[1]</sup></a> from the glades of
the forest (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>vana</em></span>) or recess in the rocks (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>gupha</em></span>), issue their oracles
to those whom chance or design may conduct to their solitary
dwellings. It is not surprising that the mandates of such beings
prove compulsory on the superstitious Rajput: we do not mean
those squalid ascetics, who wander about India, and are objects
disgusting to the eye; but the genuine Jogi, he who, as the
term imports, mortifies the flesh, till the wants of humanity are
restricted merely to what suffices to unite matter with spirit;
who has studied and comprehended the mystic works, and pored
over the systems of philosophy, until the full influence of Maya
(illusion) has perhaps unsettled his understanding; or whom
the rules of his sect have condemned to penance and solitude;
a penance so severe, that we remain astonished at the perversity
of reason which can submit to it.<a id='r5.3.2' /><a href='#f5.3.2' class='c013'><sup>[2]</sup></a> To these, the Druids of India,
the prince and the chieftain would resort for instruction. They
requested neither lands nor gold: to them “the boasted wealth
of Bokhara” was as a particle of dust. Such was the ascetic
who recommended Jodha to erect his castle on ‘the Hill of
Strife’ (Jodhagir), hitherto known as Bakharchiriya, or ‘the
bird’s nest,’ a projecting elevation of the same range on which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_949'>949</span>Mandor was placed, and about four miles south of it. Doubtless
its inaccessible position seconded the recommendation of the
hermit, for its scarped summit renders it almost impregnable
[20], while its superior elevation permits the sons of Jodha to
command, from the windows of their palace, a range of vision
almost comprehending the limits of their sway. In clear weather
they can view the summits of their southern barrier, the gigantic
Aravalli; but in every other direction it fades away in the
boundless expanse of sandy plains. Neither the founder, nor his
monitor, the ascetic, however, were engineers, and they laid the
foundation of this stronghold without considering what an indispensable
adjunct to successful defence was good water; but
to prevent any slur on the memory of Jodha, they throw the
blame of this defect on the hermit. Jodha’s engineer, in tracing
the line of circumvallation, found it necessary to include the
spot chosen as his hermitage, and his remonstrance for undisturbed
possession was treated with neglect; whether by the prince as
well as the chief architect, the legend says not. The incensed
Jogi pronounced an imprecation, that the new castle should
possess only brackish water, and all the efforts made by succeeding
princes to obtain a better quality, by blasting the rock, have failed.
The memory of the Jogi is sanctified, though his anger compelled
them to construct an apparatus, whereby water for the supply of
the garrison is elevated from a small lake at the foot of the rock,
which, being entirely commanded from the walls, an assailant
would find difficult to cut off. This was the third grand event in
the fortunes of the Rathors, from the settlement of Siahji.<a id='r5.3.3' /><a href='#f5.3.3' class='c013'><sup>[3]</sup></a></div>

<p class='c001'>Such was the abundant progeny of these princes, that the
limits of their conquests soon became too contracted. The issue
of the three last princes, namely, the fourteen sons of Chonda,
the twenty-four of Ranmall, and fourteen of Jodha, had already
apportioned amongst them the best lands of the country, and it
became necessary to conquer “fresh fields in which to sow the
Rathor seed.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The sixth son, Bika, followed the path already trod by his

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Death of Rāo Jodha, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1488.</h4>—Jodha outlived the foundation
of his new capital thirty years, and beheld his [22] sons
and grandsons rapidly peopling and subjugating the regions of
Maru. In S. 1545, aged sixty-one, he departed this life, and his
ashes were housed with those of his fathers, in the ancestral
abode of Mandor. This prince, the second founder of his race
in these regions, was mainly indebted to the adversities of early
life for the prosperity his later years enjoyed; they led him to
the discovery of worth in the more ancient, but neglected, allodial
proprietors displaced by his ancestors, and driven into the least
accessible regions of the desert. It was by their aid he was
enabled to redeem Mandor, when expelled by the Guhilots, and
he nobly preserved the remembrance thereof in the day of his
prosperity. The warriors whose forms are sculptured from the
living rock at Mandor owe the perpetuity of their fame to the
gratitude of Jodha; through them he not only recovered, but
enlarged his dominions.<a id='r5.3.6' /><a href='#f5.3.6' class='c013'><sup>[6]</sup></a> In less than three centuries after
their migration from Kanauj, the Rathors, the issue of Siahji,
spread over a surface of four degrees of longitude and the same
extent of latitude, or nearly 80,000 miles square, and they amount
at this day, in spite of the havoc occasioned, by perpetual wars
and famine, to 500,000 souls.<a id='r5.3.7' /><a href='#f5.3.7' class='c013'><sup>[7]</sup></a> While we thus contemplate the
renovation of the Rathor race, from a single scion of that magnificent
tree, whose branches once overshadowed the plains of Ganga,
let us withdraw from oblivion some of the many noble names
they displaced, which now live only in the poet’s page. Well
may the Rajput repeat the ever-recurring simile, “All is unstable;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_952'>952</span>life is like the scintillation of the fire-fly; house and land will
depart, but a good name will last for ever!” What a list of
noble tribes could we enumerate now erased from independent

years, and had at least the merit of adding to the stock of
Siahji.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Rape of the Virgins.</h4>—The contentions for empire, during
the vacillating dynasty of the Lodi kings of Delhi, preserved the
sterile lands of Maru from their cupidity; and a second dynasty,
the Shershahi, intervened ere “the sons of Jodha” were summoned
to measure swords with the Imperialists. But in S. 1572 (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span>
1516), a desultory [23] band of Pathans made an incursion during
the fair of the Tij,<a id='r5.3.10' /><a href='#f5.3.10' class='c013'><sup>[10]</sup></a> held at the town of Pipar, and carried off one
hundred and forty of the maidens of Maru. The tidings of the
rape of the virgin Rajputnis were conveyed to Suja, who put
himself at the head of such vassals as were in attendance, and
pursued, overtook, and redeemed them, with the loss of his own
life, but not without a full measure of vengeance against the
“northern barbarian.” The subject is one chosen by the itinerant
minstrel of Maru, who, at the fair of the Tij, still sings the rape
of the one hundred and forty virgins of Pipar, and their rescue
by their cavalier prince at the price of his own blood.</div>

<p class='c001'>Suja had five sons, namely: 1. Bhaga, who died in non-age:
his son Ganga succeeded to the throne. 2. Uda, who had eleven
sons: they formed the clan Udawat, whose chief fiefs are Nimaj,
Jaitaran, Gundoj, Baratia, Raepur, etc., besides places in Mewar.
3. Saga, from whom descended the clan Sagawat; located at
Barwa. 4. Prayag, who originated the Prayaggot clan. 5.
Biramdeo, whose son, Naru, receives divine honours as the Putra
of Maru, and whose statue is worshipped at Sojat. His descendants
<span class='pageno' id='Page_953'>953</span>are styled Narawat Jodha, of whom a branch is established at
Pachpahar, in Haraoti.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Rāo Ganga, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1516-32.</h4>—Ganga, grandson of Suja, succeeded
his grandfather in S. 1572 (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1516); but his uncle, Saga,
determined to contest his right to the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>gaddi</em></span>, invited the aid of
Daulat Khan Lodi, who had recently expelled the Rathors from
Nagor. With this auxiliary a civil strife commenced, and the
sons of Jodha were marshalled against each other. Ganga, confiding
in the rectitude of his cause, and reckoning upon the
support of the best swords of Maru, spurned the offer of compromise
made by the Pathan, of a partition of its lands between
the claimants, and gave battle, in which his uncle Saga was slain,
and his auxiliary, Daulat Khan, ignominiously defeated.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Rāthors join Mewār against Bābur, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1527.</h4>—Twelve years
after the accession of Ganga, the sons of Jodha were called on to
unite their forces to Mewar to oppose the invasion of the Moguls
from Turkistan. Sanga Rana, who had resumed the station of
his ancestors amongst the princes of Hind, led the war, and the
king of Maru deemed it no degradation to acknowledge his
supremacy, and send his quotas to fight under the standard of
Mewar, whose chronicles do more justice to the Rathors than
those of their own bards. This, which was the last confederation
made by the Rajputs for national independence [24], was defeated,
as already related, in the fatal field of Bayana, where, had
treachery not aided the intrepid Babur, the Rathor sword would
have had its full share in rescuing the nation from the Muhammadan
yoke. It is sufficient to state that a Rathor was in the battle,
to know that he would bear its brunt; and although we are
ignorant of the actual position of the Rana, we may assume that
their post was in the van. The young prince Raemall (grandson
of Ganga), with the Mertia chieftains Kharto and Ratna, and
many others of note, fell against the Chagatai on this eventful
day.</div>

<p class='c001'>Ganga died<a id='r5.3.11' /><a href='#f5.3.11' class='c013'><sup>[11]</sup></a> four years after this event, and was succeeded by</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Rāo Māldeo, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1532-62, or 1568-69.</h4>—Maldeo in S. 1588
(<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1532),<a id='r5.3.12' /><a href='#f5.3.12' class='c013'><sup>[12]</sup></a> a name as distinguished as any of the noble princes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_954'>954</span>in the chronicles of Maru. The position of Marwar at this period
was eminently excellent for the increase and consolidation of its
resources. The emperor Babur found no temptation in her
sterile lands to divert him from the rich plains of the Ganges,
where he had abundant occupation; and the districts and strongholds
on the emperor’s frontier of Maru, still held by the officers
of the preceding dynasty, were rapidly acquired by Maldeo, who
planted his garrisons in the very heart of Dhundhar. The death
of Sanga Rana, and the misfortunes of the house of Mewar, cursed
with a succession of minor princes, and at once beset by the
Moguls from the north, and the kings of Gujarat, left Maldeo to
the uncontrolled exercise of his power, which, like a true Rajput, he
employed against friend and foe, and became beyond a doubt the
first prince of Rajwara, or, in fact, as styled by the Muhammadan
historian Ferishta, “the most potent prince in Hindustan.”<a id='r5.3.13' /><a href='#f5.3.13' class='c013'><sup>[13]</sup></a></div>

<p class='c001'>The year of Maldeo’s installation he redeemed the two most
important possessions of his house, Nagor and Ajmer. In S. 1596
he captured Jalor, Siwana, and Bhadrajan from the Sandhals;
and two years later dispossessed the sons of Bika of supreme
power in Bikaner. Mewa, and the tracts on the Luni, the earliest
possessions of his house, which had thrown off all dependence,
he once more subjugated, and compelled the ancient allodial
tenantry to hold of him in chief, and serve with their quotas.
He engaged in war with the Bhattis, and conquered Bikampur,
where a branch of his family remained, and are now incorporated
with the Jaisalmer State, and, under the name of Maldots,<a id='r5.3.14' /><a href='#f5.3.14' class='c013'><sup>[14]</sup></a> have
the credit of being the most daring robbers of the desert. He even
established branches of [25] his family in Mewar and Dhundhar,
took, and fortified Chatsu, not twenty miles south of the capital
of the Kachhwahas. He captured and restored Sirohi from the
Deoras, from which house was his mother. But Maldeo not only
acquired, but determined to retain, his conquests, and erected
numerous fortifications throughout the country. He enclosed
the city of Jodhpur with a strong wall, besides erecting a palace,
and adding other works to the fortress. The circumvallations
of Merta and its fort, which he called Malkot, cost him £24,000.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_955'>955</span>He dismantled Satalmer, and with the materials fortified Pokaran,
which he took from the Bhattis, transplanting the entire population,
which comprehended the richest merchants of Rajasthan.
He erected forts at Bhadrajan, on the hill of Bhimlod, near
Siwana, at Gundoj, at Rian, Pipar, and Dunara. He made the
Kundalkot at Siwana, and greatly added to that of Phalodi, first
made by Hamira Nirawat. He also erected that bastion in Garh
Bitli (the citadel of Ajmer) called the Kotburj, and showed his
skill in hydraulics by the construction of a wheel to bring water
into the fort. The chronicler adds, that “by the wealth of
Sambhar,” meaning the resources of this salt lake, he was enabled
to accomplish these works, and furnishes a list of the possessions
of Jodhpur at this period, which we cannot exclude: Sojat,
Sambhar, Merta, Khata, Badnor, Ladnun, Raepur, Bhadrajan,
Nagor, Siwana, Lohagarh, Jaikalgarh, Bikaner, Bhinmal,
Pokaran, Barmer, Kasoli, Riwaso, Jajawar, Jalor, Baoli, Malar,
Nadol, Phalodi, Sanchor, Didwana, Chatsu, Lawen, Malarna,
Deora, Fatehpur, Amarsar, Khawar, Baniapur, Tonk, Toda,
Ajmer, Jahazpur, and Pramar-ka-Udaipur (in Shaikhavati); in
all thirty-eight districts, several of which, as Jalor, Ajmer, Tonk,
Toda, and Badnor, comprehended each three hundred and sixty
townships, and there were none which did not number eighty.
But of those enumerated in Dhundhar, as Chatsu, Lawen, Tonk,
Toda, and Jahazpur in Mewar, the possession was but transient;
and although Badnor, and its three hundred and sixty townships,
were peopled by Rathors, they were the descendants of the
Mertias under Jaimall, who became one of the great vassals of
Mewar, and would, in its defence, at all times draw their swords
against the land which gave them birth.<a id='r5.3.15' /><a href='#f5.3.15' class='c013'><sup>[15]</sup></a> This branch of the
house of Jodha had for some time been too powerful [26] for
subjects, and Merta was resumed. To this act Mewar was indebted
for the services of this heroic chief. At the same time
the growing power of others of the great vassalage of Marwar
was checked by resumptions, when Jaitaran from the Udawats,
and several other fiefs, were added to the fisc. The feudal allotments
had never been regulated, but went on increasing with
the energies of the State, and the progeny of its princes, each
having on his birth an appanage assigned to him, until the whole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_956'>956</span>land of Maru was split into innumerable portions. Maldeo saw the
necessity for checking this subdivision, and he created a gradation
of ranks, and established its perpetuity in certain branches of the
sons of Ranmall and Jodha, which has never been altered.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Inhospitable Conduct of Rāo Māldeo to Humāyūn, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1542.</h4>—Ten
years of undisturbed possession were granted Maldeo to
perfect his designs, ere his cares were diverted from these to his
own defence. Babur, the founder of the Mogul dynasty, was
dead, and his son and successor had been driven from his newly
conquered throne by his provincial lieutenant, Sher Shah: so
rapidly do revolutions crowd upon each other where the sword
is the universal arbitrator. We have elsewhere related that the
fugitive monarch sought the protection of Maldeo, and we stigmatized
his conduct as unnational; but we omitted to state that
Maldeo, then heir-apparent, lost his eldest, perhaps then only
son Raemall in the battle of Bayana, who led the aid of Marwar
on that memorable day, and consequently the name of Chagatai,
whether in fortune or in flight, had no great claims to his regard.
But little did Maldeo dream how closely the fortunes of his
house would be linked with those of the fugitive Humayun, and
that the infant Akbar, born in this emergency, was destined to
revenge this breach of hospitality. Still less could the proud
Rathor, who traced his ancestry on the throne of Kanauj one
thousand years before the birth of the “barbarian” of Ferghana,
deem it within the range of probability, that he should receive
honours at such hands, or that the first title of Raja, Rajeswar,
or ‘raja, lord of rajas,’ would be conferred on his own son by
this infant, then rearing amidst the sandhills at the extremity of
his desert dominion! It is curious to indulge in the speculative
inquiry, whether, when the great Akbar girded Udai Singh with
the sword of honour, and marked his forehead with the unguent
of Raja-shah, he brought to mind the conduct of Maldeo, which
doomed his birth to take place in the dismal castle of Umarkot,
instead of in the splendid halls of Delhi [27].</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Attack on Mārwār by Sher Shāh, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1544.</h4>—Maldeo derived
no advantage from his inhospitality; for whether the usurper
deemed his exertions insufficient to secure the royal fugitive, or
felt his own power insecure with so potent a neighbour, he led
an army of eighty thousand men into Marwar. Maldeo allowed
them to advance, and formed an army of fifty thousand Rajputs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_957'>957</span>to oppose him. The judgment and caution he exercised were
so great, that Sher Shah, well versed in the art of war, was obliged
to fortify his camp at every step. Instead of an easy conquest,
he soon repented of his rashness when the admirable dispositions
of the Rajputs made him dread an action, and from a position
whence he found it impossible to retreat. For a month the armies
lay in sight of each other, every day the king’s situation becoming
more critical, and from which he saw not the slightest chance of
extrication. In this exigence he had recourse to one of those
stratagems which have often operated successfully on the Rajput,
by sowing distrust in his mind as to the fidelity of his vassals.
He penned a letter, as if in correspondence with them, which he
contrived to have dropped, as by accident, by a messenger sent
to negotiate. Perhaps the severity of the resumptions of estates
seconded this scheme of Sher Shah; for when the stipulated
period for the attack had arrived, the raja countermanded it.
The reasons for this conduct, when success was apparent, were
soon propagated; when one or two of the great leaders, in order
to demonstrate their groundlessness, gave an instance of that
devotion with which the annals of these States abound. At the
head of twelve thousand, they attacked and forced the imperial
entrenched camp, carrying destruction even to the quarters of
the emperor; but multitudes prevailed, and the patriotic clans
were almost annihilated. Maldeo, when too late, saw through
the stratagem which had made him doubt the loyalty of his
vassals. Superstition and the reproaches of his chieftains for his
unworthy suspicions, did the rest; and this first <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>levée en masse</em></span>
of the descendants of Siahji, arrayed in defence of their national
liberties, was defeated. With justice did the usurper pay homage
to their gallantry, when he exclaimed, on his deliverance from
this peril, “he had nearly lost the empire of Hindustan for a
handful of barley.”<a id='r5.3.16' /><a href='#f5.3.16' class='c013'><sup>[16]</sup></a></div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Attack by Akbar, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1558-62.</h4>—Maldeo was destined to outlive
the Shershahi dynasty, and to see the imperial crown of India
once more encircle the brows of the fugitive Humayun.<a id='r5.3.17' /><a href='#f5.3.17' class='c013'><sup>[17]</sup></a> It had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_958'>958</span>[28] been well for the Rathors had his years been lengthened;
for his mild disposition and natural indolence of character gave
them some chance that these qualities would be their best advocate.
But he did not long survive the restoration. Whether the
mother of his successor, prince Akbar, not yet fifteen, stimulated
by the recollection of her misfortunes, nursed his young animosity
against Maldeo for the miseries of Umarkot, or, whether it was
merely an act of cautionary policy to curb the Rajput power,
which was inconsistent with his own, in S. 1617 (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1561) he
invaded Marwar, and laid siege to Malakot or Merta, which he
took after an obstinate and sanguinary defence, part of the
garrison cutting their way through his host, and making good
their retreat to their prince.<a id='r5.3.18' /><a href='#f5.3.18' class='c013'><sup>[18]</sup></a> The important castle of Nagor was
also captured; and both these strongholds and their lands were
conferred by Akbar on the younger branch of the family, Rae
Singh, prince of Bikaner, now established in independence of the
parent State, Jodhpur.</div>

<p class='c001'>In 1625 (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1569), Maldeo succumbed to necessity; and in
conformity with the times, sent his second son, Chandarsen,<a id='r5.3.19' /><a href='#f5.3.19' class='c013'><sup>[19]</sup></a>
with gifts to Akbar, then at Ajmer, which had become an integral
part of the monarchy; but Akbar was so dissatisfied with the
disdainful bearing of the desert king, who refused personally to
pay his court, that he not only guaranteed the free possession of
Bikaner to Rae Singh, but presented him with the farman for
Jodhpur itself, with supremacy over his race. Chandarsen
appears to have possessed all the native pride of the Rathor, and
to have been prepared to contest his country’s independence, in
spite of Akbar and the claims of his elder brother, Udai Singh,
who eventually was more supple in ingratiating himself into the
monarch’s favour. At the close of life the old Rao had to stand
a siege in his capital, and after a brave but fruitless resistance,<a id='r5.3.20' /><a href='#f5.3.20' class='c013'><sup>[20]</sup></a>
was obliged to yield homage, and pay it in the person of his son
<span class='pageno' id='Page_959'>959</span>Udai Singh, who, attending with a contingent, was enrolled
amongst the commanders of ‘one thousand’; and shortly after
was invested with the title of Mota Raja, or ‘the fat Raja,’ by
which epithet alone he is designated in the annals of that period.<a id='r5.3.21' /><a href='#f5.3.21' class='c013'><sup>[21]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Chandarsen, with a considerable number of the brave vassals
of Maru, determined to cling to independence and the rude fare
of the desert, rather than servilely follow in the train of the
despot. When driven from Jodhpur, they took post in Siwana,
in the western extremity of the State, and there held out to the
death. For seventeen years he maintained his title to the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>gaddi</em></span>,
and divided the allegiance of [29] the Rathors with his elder
brother Udai Singh (though supported by the king), and stood
the storm in which he nobly fell, leaving three sons, Ugarsen,
Askaran, and Rao Singh, who fought a duel with Rao Surthan,
of Sirohi, and was slain, with twenty-four of his chiefs,<a id='r5.3.22' /><a href='#f5.3.22' class='c013'><sup>[22]</sup></a> near the
town of Datani.</p>

<p class='c001'>Maldeo, though he submitted to acknowledge the supremacy
of the emperor, was at least spared the degradation of seeing a
daughter of his blood bestowed upon the opponent of his faith;
he died soon after the title was conferred on his son, which sealed
the dependence of Maru. His latter days were a dismal contrast
to those which witnessed his conquests in almost every <a id='corr959.22'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='part o  Rajputana'>part of Rajputana</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_959.22'><ins class='correction' title='part o  Rajputana'>part of Rajputana</ins></a></span>, but he departed from this world in time to preserve
his own honour untarnished, with the character of the most
valiant and energetic Rajput of his time. Could he have added
to his years and maintained their ancient vigour, he might, by a
junction with Partap of Mewar, who single-handed commenced
his career just as Maldeo’s closed, have maintained Rajput independence
against the rising power of the Moguls.<a id='r5.3.23' /><a href='#f5.3.23' class='c013'><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c024'>CHAPTER 4</h3>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Vassalage of Mārwār to the Mughals.</h4>—The death of Maldeo
formed an important epoch in the annals of the Rathors. Up to
this period the will had waited upon the wish of the gallant
descendants of Siva; but now the vassals of Maru acknowledged
one mightier than they. The banner of the empire floated pre-eminent
over the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>panchranga</em></span>, the five-coloured flag, which had
led the Rathors from victory to victory, and waved from the
sandhills of Umarkot to the salt-lake of Sambhar; from the desert
bordering the Gara to the peaks of the Aravalli. Henceforward,
the Rathor princes had, by their actions or subservience, to ascend
by degrees the steps to royal favour. They were required to
maintain a contingent of their proud vassals, headed by the heir,
to serve at the Mogul’s pleasure. Their deeds won them, not
ignobly, the grace of the imperial court; but had slavish submission
been the sole path to elevation, the Rathor princes would
never have attained a grade beyond the first mansab,<a id='r5.4.1' /><a href='#f5.4.1' class='c013'><sup>[1]</sup></a> conferred
on Udai Singh. Yet though streams of wealth enriched the
barren plains of Maru; although a portion of the spoils of Golkonda
and Bijapur augmented its treasures, decorated its
palaces, and embellished its edifices and mausoleums; although
the desert kings took the ‘right hand’ of all the feudality of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_961'>961</span>Hind, whether indigenous or foreign—a feudal assemblage of no
less than seventy-six petty kingdoms—yet the Rathor felt the
sense of his now degraded condition, and it often burst forth even
in the presence of the suzerain.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Rāo Udai Singh, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1581-95.</h4>—Maldeo’s death occurred in
S. 1625;<a id='r5.4.2' /><a href='#f5.4.2' class='c013'><sup>[2]</sup></a> but the chronicles do not admit of Udai [31] Singh’s
elevation until the death of his brother Chandarsen, from which
period we may reckon that he was, though junior, the choice both
of his father and the nobles, who did not approve of Udai Singh’s
submission to Akbar. In fact, the Raja led the royal forces
against the most powerful of his vassals, and resumed almost all
the possessions of the Mertias, and weakened the others.</div>

<p class='c001'>Before we proceed to trace the course pursued by Udai Singh,
who was seated upon the cushion of Maldeo in S. 1640 (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1584),
let us cast a short retrospect over the annals of Maru, since the
migration of the grandson of the potentate of Kanauj, which,
compared with the ample page of western history, present little
more than a chronicle of hard names, though not destitute of
facts interesting to political science.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Retrospect of Mārwār History.</h4>—In the table before the reader,
aided by the explanations in the text, he will see the whole process
of the conquest, peopling, and settlement of an extensive region,
with its partition or allotments amongst an innumerable frèrage
(<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>bhayyad</em></span>), whose children continue to hold them as vassals of
their king and brother, the descendant of their mutual ancestor
Siahji.</div>

<p class='c001'>We may divide the annals of Marwar, from the migration of
Siahji from Kanauj to the accession of Udai Singh, into three
distinct epochs:</p>

<p class='c001'>1. From the settlement of Siahji in the land of Kher, in <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>
1212, to the conquest of Mandor by Chonda, in <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1381.</p>

<p class='c001'>2. From the conquest of Mandor to the founding of Jodhpur,
in <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1459; and</p>

<p class='c001'>3. From the founding of Jodhpur to the accession of Udai
Singh in <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1584, when the Rathors acknowledged the supremacy
of the empire.</p>

<p class='c001'>The two first epochs were occupied in the subjugation of the
western portion of the desert from the ancient allodiality; nor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_962'>962</span>was it until Chonda conquered Mandor, on the decline of the
Chauhans of the east, that the fertile lands on either side of the
Luni were formed into fiefs for the children of Ranmall and Jodha.
A change of capital with the Rajput is always productive of
change in the internal organisation of the State; and not unfrequently
the race changes its appellation with its capital.
The foundation of Jodhpur was a new era, and henceforth
the throne of Maru could only be occupied by the tribe of
Jodha, and from branches not constituting the vassals of the
crown, who were cut off from succession. This is a peculiar
[32] feature in Rajput policy, and is common to the whole
race, as will be hereafter more distinctly pointed out in the
annals of Ajmer.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Feudalism in Mārwār.</h4>—Jodha, with all the ambition of the
founder of a State, gave a new form to the feudal institutions of
his country. Necessity, combined with pride, led him to promulgate
a statute of limitation of the sub-infeudations of Maru.
The immense progeny of his father Ranmall, twenty-four sons,
and his own, of fourteen, almost all of whom had numerous issue,
rendered it requisite to fix the number and extent of the fiefs;
and amongst them, henceforward constituting permanently the
frèrage of Maru, the lands were partitioned, Kandhal having
emigrated and established his own numerous issue, the Kandhalots,
in Bikaner. The two brothers next to Jodha, namely,
Champa and Kumpa, with his two sons, Duda and Karamsi, and
his grandson, Uda, were declared the heads of the feudal association
under their names, the Champawats, Kumpawats, Mertias
(sons of Duda), Karamsots, and Udawats, and continue to be
“the pillars of Maru.” Eight great estates, called the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>ath thakurat</em></span>,
or ‘eight lordships’ of Marwar, each of the nominal annual value
of fifty thousand rupees (£5000), were settled on these persons,
and their immense influence has obtained many others for
younger branches of their clans. The title of the first noble of
Maru was given to Champa and his issue, who have often made
its princes tremble on their thrones. Besides these, inferior
appanages were settled on the junior branches, brothers, sons,
and grandsons of Jodha, which were also deemed hereditary and
irresumable; to use their own phrase, their <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>bat</em></span>,<a id='r5.4.3' /><a href='#f5.4.3' class='c013'><sup>[3]</sup></a> or ‘allotment,’
to which they consider their title as sacred as that of their prince
<span class='pageno' id='Page_963'>963</span>to his throne, of whom they say, “When our services are acceptable,
then is he our lord; when not, we are again his brothers and
kin, claimants, and laying claim to the land.”<a id='r5.4.4' /><a href='#f5.4.4' class='c013'><sup>[4]</sup></a></div>

<p class='c001'>Rao Maldeo confirmed this division of Jodha, though he
increased the secondary fiefs, and as the boundaries of Marwar
were completed in his reign, it was essentially necessary to confirm
the limitation. The feudal States of Marwar are, therefore,
perpetuated in the offspring of the princes from Jodha to Maldeo,
and a distinction exists between them and those subsequently
conferred; the first, being [33] obtained by conquest, are deemed
irrevocable, and must be perpetuated by adoption on the failure
of lineal issue; whereas the other may, on lapses, be resumed and
added to the fisc whence it emanated. The fiscal domain of the
Rajput princes cannot, says their traditionary lore, be alienated
for more than a life-interest; but this wise rule, though visible
in anecdotes of past days, has been infringed with their general
disorganization. These instances, it may be asserted, afford the
distinctions of allodial and feudal lands. Of the numerous clans,
the issue of Siahji to Jodha, which are spread over the northern
and western parts of the State, some, partly from the difficulty
of their position, partly from a feeling of respect to their remote
ancestry, enjoy almost entire independence. Yet they recognize
the prince of Maru as their liege lord when his crown is endangered,
and render homage on his accession or any great family event.
These clans hold without grant or fine, and may properly be called
the allodial chieftains. Of this number we may enumerate the
lordships of Barmer, Kotra, Sheo, Phulsund, etc. Others there
are who, though less independent, may also be styled the allodiality
of Marwar, who are to furnish their quotas when demanded,
and perform personal homage on all great days of rejoicing; of
these are Mewa, Sindari, etc. The ancient clans scattered over
the land, or serving the more modern chieftains, are recognized
by their patronymic distinctions, by those versed in the chronicles;
though many hear the names of Duharka, Mangalia, Uhar, and
Dhandal, without knowing them to be Rathor. The mystic page
of the bard is always consulted previous to any marriage, in order
to prevent a violation of the matrimonial canons of the Rajputs,
which are stricter than the Mosaic, and this keeps up the knowledge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_964'>964</span>of the various branches of their own and other races, which
would otherwise <a id='corr964.2'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='perish'>perish.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_964.2'><ins class='correction' title='perish'>perish.</ins></a></span></p>

<p class='c001'>Whatever term may be applied to these institutions of a
martial race, and which for the sake of being more readily understood
we have elsewhere called, and shall continue to designate,
“feudal,” we have not a shadow of doubt that they were common
to the Rajput races from the remotest ages, and that Siahji
conveyed them from the seat of his ancestors, Kanauj. A finer
picture does not exist of the splendour of a feudal array than the
camp of its last monarch, Jaichand, in the contest with the
Chauhan. The annals of each and every State bear evidence to
a system strictly parallel to that of Europe; more especially
Mewar, where, thirteen hundred years ago, we see the entire
feudatories of the State throwing up their grants, giving their
liege lord defiance, and threatening him with their [34] vengeance.
Yet, having “eaten his salt,” they forbore to proceed to hostilities
till a whole year had elapsed, at the expiration of which they
deposed him.<a id='r5.4.5' /><a href='#f5.4.5' class='c013'><sup>[5]</sup></a> Akbar, who was partial to Hindu institutions,
borrowed much from them, in all that concerned his own
regulations.</p>

<p class='c001'>In contrasting these customs with analogous ones in the West,
the reader should never lose sight of one point, which must
influence the analogy, namely, the patriarchal form which
characterizes the feudal system in all countries; and as, amongst
the Rajputs, all their vassalage is of their own kin and blood
(save a slight mixture of foreign nobles as a counterpoise), the
paternity of the sovereign is no fiction, as in Europe; so that
from the son of Champa, who takes the right hand of his prince,
to the meanest vassal, who serves merely for his <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>peti</em></span><a id='r5.4.6' /><a href='#f5.4.6' class='c013'><sup>[6]</sup></a> (rations),
all are linked by the tie of consanguinity, of which it is difficult
to say whether it is most productive of evil or good, since it has
afforded examples as brilliant and as dark as any in the history
of mankind. The devotion which made twelve thousand, out
of the fifty thousand, “sons of Jodha” prove their fidelity to
Maldeo has often been emulated even to the present day.</p>

<p class='c001'>The chronicles, as before stated, are at variance with regard
to the accession of Udai Singh: some date it from the death of
Maldeo, in S. 1625 (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1569); others from that of his elder
brother Chandarsen, slain in the storm of Siwana. The name of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_965'>965</span>Udai appears one of evil portent in the annals of Rajasthan.<a id='r5.4.7' /><a href='#f5.4.7' class='c013'><sup>[7]</sup></a>
While “Udai, the fat,” was inhaling the breeze of imperial power,
which spread a haze of prosperity over Maru, Partap of Mewar,
the idol of the Rajputs, was enduring every hardship in the
attempt to work out his country’s independence, which had been
sacrificed by his father, Udai Singh. In this he failed, but he left
a name hallowed in the hearts of his countrymen, and immortalized
in the imperishable verse of the bard.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the union of the imperial house with that of Jodhpur, by
the marriage of Jodh Bai to Akbar,<a id='r5.4.8' /><a href='#f5.4.8' class='c013'><sup>[8]</sup></a> the emperor not only restored
all the possessions he had wrested from Marwar, with the exception
of Ajmer, but several rich districts in Malwa, whose revenues
doubled the resources of his own fiscal domain. With the aid
of his imperial brother-in-law, he greatly diminished the power
of the feudal aristocracy [35], and clipped the wings of almost
all the greater vassals, while he made numerous sequestrations
of the lands of the ancient allodiality and lesser vassals; so that
it is stated, that, either by new settlement or confiscation, he
added fourteen hundred villages to the fisc. He resumed almost
all the lands of the sons of Duda, who, from their abode, were
termed Mertia; took Jaitaran from the Udawats, and other
towns of less note from the sons of Champa and Kumpa.</p>

<p class='c001'>Udai Singh was not ungrateful for the favours heaped upon
him by the emperor, for whom his Rathors performed many
signal services: for the raja was latterly too unwieldy for any
steed to bear him to battle. The “king of the Desert” (the
familiar epithet applied to him by Akbar) had a numerous progeny;
no less than thirty-four legitimate sons and daughters, who added
new clans and new estates to the feudal association of Maru:
of these the most conspicuous are Govindgarh and Pisangan;
while some obtained settlements beyond its limits which became
independent and bear the name of the founders. Of these are
Kishangarh and Ratlam in Malwa.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Death of Rāo Udai Singh.</h4>—Udai Singh died thirteen years
after his inauguration on the cushion of Jodha, and thirty-three
<span class='pageno' id='Page_966'>966</span>after the death of Maldeo. The manner of his death, as related
in the biographical sketches termed Khyat, affords such a specimen
of superstition and of Rajput manners that it would be improper
to omit it. The narrative is preceded by some reflections on
the moral education of the Rathor princes, and the wise restraints
imposed upon them under the vigilant control of chiefs of approved
worth and fidelity; so that, to use the words of the text, “they
often passed their twentieth year, ignorant of woman.” If the
“fat raja” had ever known this moral restraint, in his riper years
he forgot it; for although he had no less than twenty-seven
queens, he cast the eye of desire on the virgin-daughter of a
subject, and that subject a Brahman.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Brāhman sacrifices his Daughter.</h4>—It was on the raja’s return
from court to his native land that he beheld the damsel, and
he determined, notwithstanding the sacred character of her
father and his own obligations as the dispenser of law and justice,
to enjoy the object of his admiration. The Brahman was an
Ayapanthi,<a id='r5.4.9' /><a href='#f5.4.9' class='c013'><sup>[9]</sup></a> or votary of Ayamata, whose shrine is at Bhavi-Bhilara.
These sectarians of Maru, very different from the abstinent
Brahmans of Bengal, eat flesh, drink wine, and share in all the
common enjoyments of life with the martial spirits around them.
Whether the scruples of the [36] daughter were likely to be easily
overcome by her royal tempter, or whether the raja threatened
force, the Khyat does not inform us; but as there was no other
course by which the father could save her from pollution but by
her death, he resolved to make it one of vengeance and horror.
He dug a sacrificial pit, and having slain his daughter, cut her
into fragments, and mingling therewith pieces of flesh from his
own person, made the Homa, or burnt sacrifice to Ayamata,
and as the smoke and flames ascended he pronounced an imprecation
on the raja: “Let peace be a stranger to him! and in
three pahars,<a id='r5.4.10' /><a href='#f5.4.10' class='c013'><sup>[10]</sup></a> three days, and three years, let me have revenge!”
Then exclaiming, “My future dwelling is the Dabhi Baori!”
sprung into the flaming pit. The horrid tale was related to the
raja, whose imagination was haunted by the shade of the Brahman;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_967'>967</span>and he expired at the assigned period, a prey to unceasing
remorse.</div>

<p class='c001'>Superstition is sometimes made available for moral ends;
and the shade of the Ayapanthi Brahman of Bhilara has been
evoked, in subsequent ages, to restrain and lead unto virtue
libidinous princes, when all other control has been unavailing.
The celebrated Jaswant Singh, the great-grandson of Udai, had
an amour with the daughter of one of his civil officers, and which
he carried on at the Dabhi Baori.<a id='r5.4.11' /><a href='#f5.4.11' class='c013'><sup>[11]</sup></a> But the avenging ghost of
the Brahman interposed between him and his wishes. A dreadful
struggle ensued, in which Jaswant lost his senses, and no
effort could banish the impression from his mind. The ghost
persecuted his fancy, and he was generally believed to be possessed
with a wicked spirit, which, when exorcised, was made to say
he would only depart on the self-sacrifice of a chief equal in
dignity to Jaswant. Nahar Khan, “the tiger lord,” chief of the
Kumpawat clan, who led the van in all his battles, immediately
offered his head in expiation for his prince; and he had no
sooner expressed this loyal determination, than the holy men
who exorcised the spirit caused it to descend into a vessel of
water, and having waved it thrice round his head, they presented
it to Nahar Khan, who drank it off, and Jaswant’s senses were
instantly restored. This miraculous transfer of the ghost is
implicitly believed by every chief of Rajasthan, by whom Nahar
was called “the faithful of the faithful.” Previous to dying, he
called his son, and imposed on him and his descendants, by the
solemnity of an oath, the abjuration of the office of Pardhan, or
hereditary premier of Marwar, whose dignity involved such a
sacrifice [37]; and from that day the Champawats of Awa
succeeded the Kumpawats of Asop, who renounced the first seat
on the right for that on the left of their princes.</p>

<p class='c001'>We shall conclude the reign of Udai Singh with the register
of his issue from “the Book of Kings.” It is by no means an
unimportant document to such as are interested in these singular
communities, and essentially useful to those who are called upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_968'>968</span>to interfere in their national concerns. Here we see the affinities
of the branch (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>sakha</em></span>) to the parent tree, which in one short century
has shaded the whole land; and to which the independents of
Kishangarh, Rupnagarh, and Ratlam, as well as the feudal
chiefs of Govindgarh, Khairwa, and Pisangan, all issues from
Udai Singh, look for protection.</p>

  <h3 class='c024'>CHAPTER 5</h3>
</div>

<p class='c012'><b>Rāja Sūr Singh, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1595-1620</b>.—Sur Singh succeeded in S.
1651 (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1595). He was serving with the Imperial forces at
Lahore, where he had commanded since S. 1648, when intelligence
reached him of his father’s death. His exploits and services
were of the most brilliant nature, and had obtained for him,
even during his father’s life, the title of “Sawai Raja,”<a id='r5.5.1' /><a href='#f5.5.1' class='c013'><sup>[1]</sup></a> and a
high grade amongst the dignitaries of the empire. He was commanded
by Akbar to reduce the arrogant prince of Sirohi, who,
trusting to the natural strength of his mountainous country,
still refused to acknowledge a liege lord. This service well
accorded with his private views, for he had a feud (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>wair</em></span>) with
Rao Surthan, which, according to the chronicle, he completely
revenged. “He avenged his feud with Surthan and plundered
Sirohi. The Rao had not a pallet left to sleep upon, but was
obliged to make a bed for his wives upon the earth.” This
appears to have humbled the Deora, “who, in his pride, shot
his arrows at the sun for daring to shine upon him.”</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Campaign in Gujarāt.</h4>—Surthan accepted the imperial [39]
farman in token of submission, and agreed to serve with a contingent
of his hardy clansmen in the war then entrusted to Raja
Sur against the king of Gujarat, whose success we shall relate in
the simple language of the chronicle: “The Raja took the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>pan</em></span>
against the king Muzaffar, with the title of viceroy of Gujarat.
The armies met at Dhandhuka,<a id='r5.5.2' /><a href='#f5.5.2' class='c013'><sup>[2]</sup></a> where a terrible conflict ensued.
The Rathors lost many valiant men, but the Shah was defeated,
and lost all the insignia of his greatness. He sent the spoil of
seventeen thousand towns to the king, but kept a crore of <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>drabs</em></span><a id='r5.5.3' /><a href='#f5.5.3' class='c013'><sup>[3]</sup></a>
for himself, which he sent to Jodhpur, and therewith he enlarged
the town and fort. For this service Akbar increased his <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>mansab</em></span>,
and sent him a sword, with a khilat, and a grant of fresh lands.”</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_970'>970</span>Raja Sur, it appears in the sequel, provided liberally for the
bards; for no less than “six lords of verse,” whose names are
given, had in gift £10,000 each of the spoils of Gujarat, as incentives
to song.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the conquest of Gujarat, Raja Sur was ordered to the
Deccan. “He obeyed, and with thirteen thousand horse, ten
large guns, and twenty elephants, he fought three grand battles.
On the Rewa (Nerbudda) he attacked Amra Balecha,<a id='r5.5.4' /><a href='#f5.5.4' class='c013'><sup>[4]</sup></a> who had
five thousand horse, whom he slew, and reduced all his country.
For this service the king sent him a <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>naubat</em></span> (kettle-drum), and
conferred on him Dhar and its domain.”</p>

<p class='c001'>On Akbar’s death and the accession of Jahangir, Sur Singh
attended at court with his son and heir, Gaj Singh, whom the
king with his own hands invested with the sword, for his bravery
in the escalade of Jalor, which had been conquered by the monarch
of Gujarat and added to his domain. The poet thus relates the
event: “Gaj<a id='r5.5.5' /><a href='#f5.5.5' class='c013'><sup>[5]</sup></a> was commanded against Bihari Pathan; his
war-trump sounded; Arbuda [Abu] heard and trembled. What
took Alau-d-din years, Gaj accomplished in three months; he
escaladed Jalandhara<a id='r5.5.6' /><a href='#f5.5.6' class='c013'><sup>[6]</sup></a> sword in hand; many a Rathor of fame
was killed, but he put to the sword seven thousand Pathans,
whose spoils were sent to the king.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Raja Sur, it would appear, after the overthrow of the dynasty
of Gujarat, remained at the capital, while his son and heir, Gaj
Singh, attended the king’s [40] commands, and, soon after the
taking of Jalor, was ordered with the Marwar contingent against
Rana Amra of Mewar: it was at the very moment of its expiring
liberties,<a id='r5.5.7' /><a href='#f5.5.7' class='c013'><sup>[7]</sup></a> for the chronicle merely adds, “Karan agreed to serve
the king, and Gaj Singh returned to Taragarh.<a id='r5.5.8' /><a href='#f5.5.8' class='c013'><sup>[8]</sup></a> The king
increased both his own <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>mansab</em></span> (dignity) and that of his father,
Raja Sur.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus the Rajput chronicler, solicitous only to record the fame
of his own princes, does not deem it necessary to concern himself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_971'>971</span>with the agents conjoined with them, so that a stranger to the
events of the period would imagine, from the high relief given to
their actions, that the Rathor princes commanded in all the great
events described; for instance, that just mentioned, involving
the submission of the Rana, when Raja Gaj was merely one of
the great leaders who accompanied the Mogul heir-apparent,
Prince Khurram, on this memorable occasion. In the Diary of
Jahangir, the emperor, recording this event, does not even
mention the Rathor prince, though he does those of Kotah and
Datia, as the instruments by which Prince Khurram carried on
the negotiation;<a id='r5.5.9' /><a href='#f5.5.9' class='c013'><sup>[9]</sup></a> from which we conclude that Raja Gaj merely
acted a military part in the grand army which then invaded
Mewar.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Death of Rāja Sūr Singh, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1620: his Character.</h4>—Raja
Sur died in the Deccan, in S. 1676 (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1620). He added greatly
to the lustre of the Rathor name, was esteemed by the emperor,
and, as the bard expresses it, “His spear was frightful to the
Southron.” Whether Raja Sur disapproved of the exterminating
warfare carried on in these regions, or was exasperated at the
unlimited service he was doomed to, which detained him from
his native land, he, in his last moments, commanded a pillar to
be erected with a curse engraven thereon, imprecated upon any
of his race who should once cross the Nerbudda. From his boyhood
he had been almost an alien to his native land: he had
accompanied his father wherever he led the aid of Maru, was serving
at Lahore at the period of his accession, and died far from
the monuments of his fathers, in the heart of the peninsula.
Although the emperor was not ungrateful in his estimate of these
services,—for Raja Sur held by patent no less than “sixteen [41]
grand fiefs”<a id='r5.5.10' /><a href='#f5.5.10' class='c013'><sup>[10]</sup></a> of the empire, and with the title of Sawai raised
above all the princes, his associates at court,—it was deemed no
compensation for perpetual absence from the hereditary domain,
thus abandoned to the management of servants. The great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_972'>972</span>vassals, his clansmen, participated in this dissatisfaction, separated
from their wives, families, and estates; for to them the pomp of
imperial greatness, or the sunshine of court-favour, was as nothing
when weighed against the exercise of their influence within their
own cherished patrimony. The simple fare of the desert was
dearer to the Rathor than all the luxuries of the imperial banquet,
which he turned from with disgust to the recollection of “the
green pulse of Mandawar,” or his favourite <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>rabri</em></span>, or ‘maize
porridge,’ the prime dish with the Rathor. These minor associations
conjoined with greater evils to increase the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>mal de pays</em></span>,
of whose influence no human being is more susceptible than the
brave Rajput.</div>

<p class='c001'>Raja Sur greatly added to the beauty of his capital, and left
several works which bear his name; amongst them, not the least
useful in that arid region, is the lake called the Sur Sagar, or
‘Warrior’s Sea,’ which irrigates the gardens on its margin. He
left six sons and seven daughters, of whose issue we have no
account, namely, Gaj Singh, his successor; Sabal Singh, Biramdeo,
Bijai Singh, Partap Singh, and Jaswant Singh.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Rāja Gaj Singh, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1620-38.</h4>—Raja Gaj, who succeeded his
father in <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1620, was born at Lahore, and the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>tika</em></span> of investiture
found him in the royal camp at Burhanpur. The bearer of it
was Darab Khan, the son of the Khankhanan,<a id='r5.5.11' /><a href='#f5.5.11' class='c013'><sup>[11]</sup></a> or premier noble
of the emperor’s court, who, as the imperial proxy, girt Raja
Gaj with the sword. Besides the “nine castles” (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>Naukoti Marwar</em></span>),
his patrimony, his patent contained a grant of “seven divisions”
of Gujarat, of the district of Jhalai in Dhundhar; and what was
of more consequence to him, though of less intrinsic value, that
of Masuda in Ajmer, the heirloom of his house. Besides these
marks of distinction, he received the highest proof of confidence
in the elevated post of viceroy of the Deccan; and, as a special
testimony of imperial favour, the Rathor cavaliers composing
his contingent were exempted from the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>dagh</em></span>,<a id='r5.5.12' /><a href='#f5.5.12' class='c013'><sup>[12]</sup></a> that is, having
their steeds branded with the imperial signet. His elder son,
Amra Singh, served with [42] his father in all his various battles,
to the success of which his conspicuous gallantry on every occasion
contributed. In the sieges and battles of Kirkigarh, Golkonda,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_973'>973</span>Khelna, Parnala, Gajangarh, Asir and Satara, the Rathors had
their full share of glory, which obtained for their leader the
title of Dalthaman, or ‘barrier of the host.’ We have already<a id='r5.5.13' /><a href='#f5.5.13' class='c013'><sup>[13]</sup></a>
remarked the direct influence which the Rajput princes had in
the succession to the imperial dignity, consequent upon the inter-marriage
of their daughters with the crown, and the various
interests arising therefrom. Sultan Parvez, the elder son and
heir of Jahangir, was the issue of a princess of Marwar,<a id='r5.5.14' /><a href='#f5.5.14' class='c013'><sup>[14]</sup></a> while
the second son, Khurram, as his name imports, was the son of a
Kachhwaha<a id='r5.5.15' /><a href='#f5.5.15' class='c013'><sup>[15]</sup></a> princess of Amber. Being the offspring of polygamy
and variously educated, these princes were little disposed
to consider consanguinity as a bond of natural union; and
their respective mothers, with all the ambition of their race,
thought of nothing but obtaining the diadem for the head of
their children. With either of these rival queens, the royal
children who were not her own had no affinity with her or hers,
and these feelings were imparted from the birth to their issue,
and thus it too often happened that the heir of the throne was
looked upon with an envious eye, as a bar to be removed at all
hazards. This evil almost neutralized the great advantages
derived from intermarriage with the indigenous races of India;
but it was one which would have ceased with polygamy.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Death of Parvez, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1626.</h4>—Khurram felt his superiority over
his elder brother, Parvez, in all but the accidental circumstance
of birth. He was in every respect a better man, and a braver
and more successful soldier; and, having his ambition thus early
nurtured by the stimulants administered by Bhim of Mewar,
and the intrepid Mahabat,<a id='r5.5.16' /><a href='#f5.5.16' class='c013'><sup>[16]</sup></a> he determined to remove this barrier
<span class='pageno' id='Page_974'>974</span>between him and the crown. His views were first developed
whilst leading the armies in the Deccan, and he communicated
them to Raja Gaj of Marwar, who held the post of honour next
the prince, and solicited his aid to place him on the throne.
Gratitude for the favours heaped upon him by the king, as well
as the natural bias to Parvez, made the Raja turn a deaf ear to
his application. The prince tried to gain his point through
Govinddas, a Rajput of the Bhatti tribe, one of the foreign nobles
of Maru, and confidential adviser of his prince; but, as the annals
say, “Govinddas reckoned no one but his master and the [43]
king.” Frustrated in this, Khurram saw no hopes of success
but by disgusting the Rathors, and he caused the faithful Govinddas
to be assassinated by Kishan Singh;<a id='r5.5.17' /><a href='#f5.5.17' class='c013'><sup>[17]</sup></a> on which Raja Gaj,
in disgust, threw up his post, and marched to his native land.
From the assassination of Parvez, which soon followed,<a id='r5.5.18' /><a href='#f5.5.18' class='c013'><sup>[18]</sup></a> the
deposal of his father appeared but a step; and Khurram had
collected means, which he deemed adequate to the design, when
Jahangir appealed to the fidelity of the Rajputs, to support him
against filial ingratitude and domestic treason; and, in their
general obedience to the call, they afforded a distinguished proof
of the operation of the first principle, Gaddi-ka-an, allegiance to
the throne, often obeyed without reference to the worth of its
occupant. The princes of Marwar, Amber, Kotah, and Bundi
put themselves at the head of their household retainers on this
occasion, which furnishes a confirmation of a remark already
made, that the respective annals of the States of Rajasthan so
rarely embrace the contemporaneous events of the rest, as to
lead to the conclusion that by the single force of each State this
rebellion was put down. This remark will be further exemplified
from the annals of Bundi.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Offence given to the Rāthors.</h4>—Jahangir was so pleased with
the zeal of the Rathor prince—alarmed as he was at the advance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_975'>975</span>of the rebels—that he not only took him by the hand, but what
is most unusual, kissed it. When the assembled princes came
in sight of the rebels, near Benares, the emperor gave the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>harawal</em></span>,
or vanguard, to the Kachhwaha prince, the Mirza raja of Amber.
Whether this was a point of policy, to secure his acting against
prince Khurram, who was born of this race, or merely, as the
Marwar annals state, because he brought the greater number into
the field, is immaterial; but it was very nearly fatal in its consequences:
for the proud Rathor, indignant at the insult offered
to him in thus bestowing the post of honour, which was his right,
upon the rival race of Amber, furled his banners, separated from
the royal army, and determined to be a quiet spectator of the
result. But for the impetuous Bhim of Mewar, the adviser of
Khurram, he might that day have been emperor of India. He
sent a taunting message to Raja Gaj, either to join their cause or
“draw their swords.” The Rathors overlooked the neglect of
the king in the sarcasm of one of their own tribe; and Bhim was
slain, Govinddas avenged, the rebellion quelled, and Khurram
put to flight, chiefly by the Rathors and Haras [44].</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Death of Rāja Gaj Singh, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1638.</h4>—In S. 1694 (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1638),
Raja Gaj was slain in an expedition into Gujarat;<a id='r5.5.19' /><a href='#f5.5.19' class='c013'><sup>[19]</sup></a> but whether
in the fulfilment of the king’s commands, or in the chastisement
of freebooters on his own southern frontier, the chronicles do not
inform us. He left a distinguished name in the annals of his
country, and two valiant sons, Amra and Jaswant, to maintain
it: another son, Achal, died in infancy.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Rāja Jaswant Singh, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1638-78.</h4>—The second son, Jaswant,
succeeded, and furnishes another of many instances in the annals
of Rajputana, of the rights of primogeniture being set aside. This
proceeded from a variety of motives, sometimes merely paternal
affection, sometimes incapacity in the child “to head fifty thousand
Rathors,” and sometimes, as in the present instance, a dangerous
turbulence and ever-boiling impetuosity in the individual, which
despised all restraints. While there was an enemy against whom
to exert it, Amra was conspicuous for his gallantry, and in all his
father’s wars in the south was ever foremost in the battle. His
daring spirit collected around him those of his own race, alike in
mind, as connected by blood, whose actions, in periods of
peace, were the subjects of eternal complaint to his father,

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Amra, Amar Singh excluded from the Succession.</h4>—In the
month of Baisakh, S. 1690 (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1634), five years before the death
of Raja Gaj, in a convocation of all the feudality of Maru, sentence
of exclusion from the succession was pronounced upon Amra,
accompanied by the solemn and seldom practised rite of Desvata
or exile. This ceremony, which is marked as a day of mourning
in the calendar, was attended with all the circumstances of
funereal pomp. As soon as the sentence was pronounced, that
his birthright was forfeited and assigned to his junior brother,
and that he ceased to be a subject of Maru, the khilat of banishment
was brought forth, consisting of sable vestments, in which
he was clad; a sable shield was hung upon his back, and a sword
of the same hue girded round him; a black horse was then led
out, being mounted on which, he was commanded, though not in
anger, to depart whither he listed beyond the limits of Maru.</div>

<p class='c001'>Amra went not alone; numbers of each clan, who had always
regarded him as their future lord, voluntarily partook of his exile.
He repaired to the imperial court; and although the emperor
approved and sanctioned his banishment, he employed him. His
gallantry soon won him the title of Rao and the mansab of a
leader of three thousand, with the grant of Nagor as an independent
domain, to be held directly from the crown. But the same
arrogant and uncontrollable spirit [45] which lost him his birthright,
brought his days to a tragical conclusion. He absented
himself for a fortnight from court, hunting the boar or the tiger,
his only recreation. The emperor (Shah Jahan) reprimanded
him for neglecting his duties, and threatened him with a fine.
Amra proudly replied that he had only gone to hunt, and as for
a fine, he observed, putting his hand upon his sword, that was
his sole wealth.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Amra, Amar assassinates Salābat Khān.</h4>—The little contrition
which this reply evinced determined the king to enforce the fine,
and the paymaster-general, Salabat Khan,<a id='r5.5.20' /><a href='#f5.5.20' class='c013'><sup>[20]</sup></a> was sent to Amra’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_977'>977</span>quarters to demand its payment. It was refused, and the observations
made by the Sayyid not suiting the temper of Amra, he
unceremoniously desired him to depart. The emperor, thus
insulted in the person of his officer, issued a mandate for Amra’s
instant appearance. He obeyed, and having reached the Amm-khass,
or grand divan, beheld the king, “whose eyes were red
with anger,” with Salabat in the act of addressing him. Inflamed
with passion at the recollection of the injurious language
he had just received, perhaps at the king’s confirmation of his
exclusion from Marwar, he unceremoniously passed the Omrahs
of five and seven thousand, as if to address the king; when, with
a dagger concealed in his sleeve, he stabbed Salabat to the heart.
Drawing his sword, he made a blow at the king, which descending
on the pillar, shivered the weapon in pieces. The king abandoned
his throne and fled to the interior apartments. All was uproar
and confusion. Amra continued the work of death, indifferent
upon whom his blows fell, and five Mogul chiefs of eminence had
fallen, when his brother-in-law, Arjun Gaur, under pretence of
cajoling him, inflicted a mortal wound, though he continued to
ply his dagger until he expired. To avenge his death, his retainers,
headed by Balu Champawat and Bhao Kumpawat, put on their
saffron garments, and a fresh carnage ensued within the Lal
kila.<a id='r5.5.21' /><a href='#f5.5.21' class='c013'><sup>[21]</sup></a> To use the words of their native bard, “The pillars of

pieces; and his wife, the princess of Bundi, came in person and
[46] carried away the dead body of Amra, with which she committed
herself to the flames. The Bokhara gate by which they
gained admission was built up, and henceforward known only as

state policy of the west, and for the sake of observing that which would
actuate the present paramount power of India should any of its tributary
princes defy them as Amra did that of the universal potentate of that
country. Even these despots borrowed a lesson of mercy from the Rajput
system, which does not deem treason hereditary, nor attaints a whole line
for the fault of one unworthy link. Shah Jahan, instead of visiting the sins
of the father on the son, installed him in his fief of Nagor. This son was
Rae Singh; and it devolved to his children and grandchildren,<a id='r5.5.22.A' /><a href='#f5.5.22.A' class='c013'><sup>[A]</sup></a> until Indar
Singh the fourth in descent, was expelled by the head of the Rathors, who,
in the weakness of the empire, reannexed Nagor to Jodhpur. But perhaps
we have not hitherto dared to imitate the examples set us by the Mogul
and even by the Mahratta; not having sufficient hold of the affections
of the subjected to venture to be merciful; and thence our vengeance, like
the bolt of heaven, sears the very heart of our enemies. Witness the many
chieftains ejected from their possessions; from the unhallowed league
against the Rohillas, to that last act of destruction at Bharatpur, where,
as arbitrators, we acted the part of the lion in the fable. Our present
attitude, however, is so commanding, that we can afford to display the
attribute of mercy; and should, unfortunately, its action be required in
Rajputana, let it be ample, for there its grateful influence is understood, and
it will return, like the dews of heaven, upon ourselves. But if we are only
to regulate our political actions by the apprehension of danger, it must one
day recoil upon us in awful retribution. Our system is filled with evil to
the governed, where a fit of bile in ephemeral political agents, may engender
a quarrel leading to the overthrow of a dominion of ages.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Rāja Jaswant Singh, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1638-78.</h4>—Raja Jaswant, who
obtained, by the banishment of Amra, the “cushion” of Marwar,
was born of a princess of Mewar; and although this circumstance
is not reported to have influenced the change of succession, it will
be borne in mind that, throughout Rajputana, its princes regarded
a connexion with the Rana’s family as a primary honour.</div>

<p class='c001'>“Jaswant (says the Bardai) was unequalled amongst the
princes of his time. Stupidity and ignorance were banished;
and science flourished where he ruled: many were the books
composed under his auspices.”<a id='r5.6.1' /><a href='#f5.6.1' class='c013'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The south continued to be the arena in which the martial
Rajput sought renown, and the emperor had only rightly to
understand his character to turn the national emulation to
account. Shah Jahan, in the language of the chronicler, “became
a slave to the seraglio,” and sent his sons, as viceroys, to govern
the grand divisions of the empire. The first service of Jaswant
was in the war of Gondwana, when he led a body composed of
“twenty-two different contingents” in the army under Aurangzeb.<a id='r5.6.2' /><a href='#f5.6.2' class='c013'><sup>[2]</sup></a>
In this and various other services (to enumerate which would be
to go [48] over the ground already passed),<a id='r5.6.3' /><a href='#f5.6.3' class='c013'><sup>[3]</sup></a> the Rathors were
conspicuous. Jaswant played a comparatively subordinate part,
until the illness of the emperor, in <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1658, when his elder son
Dara was invested with the powers of regent.<a id='r5.6.4' /><a href='#f5.6.4' class='c013'><sup>[4]</sup></a> Prince Dara
increased the mansab of Jaswant to a leader of “five thousand,”
and nominated him his viceroy in Malwa.</p>

<div class='section-start'><span class='pageno' id='Page_980'>980</span><h4 class='disp-inline'>The War of Succession.</h4>—In the struggle for empire amongst
the sons of Shah Jahan, consequent upon this illness, the importance
of the Rajput princes and the fidelity we have often had
occasion to depict, were exhibited in the strongest light. While
Raja Jai Singh was commanded to oppose prince Shuja, who
advanced from his viceroyalty of Bengal, Jaswant was entrusted
with means to quash the designs of Aurangzeb, then commanding
in the south, who had long cloaked, under the garb of hypocrisy
and religion, views upon the empire.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Campaign against Aurangzeb, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1657-58—The Battle of
Dharmātpur.</h4>—The Rathor prince was declared generalissimo of the
army destined to oppose Aurangzeb, and he marched from Agra
at the head of the united contingents of Rajputana, besides the
imperial guards, a force which, to use the hyperbole of the bard,
“made Shesnag<a id='r5.6.5' /><a href='#f5.6.5' class='c013'><sup>[5]</sup></a> writhe in agony.” Jaswant marched towards
the Nerbudda, and had encamped his army in a position fifteen
miles south of Ujjain, when tidings reached him of his opponent’s
approach. In that field on which the emperor erected a town
subsequently designated Fatehabad, or ‘abode of victory,’
Jaswant awaited his foes.<a id='r5.6.6' /><a href='#f5.6.6' class='c013'><sup>[6]</sup></a> The battle which ensued, witnessed
and so circumstantially related by Bernier, as has been already
noticed in this work,<a id='r5.6.7' /><a href='#f5.6.7' class='c013'><sup>[7]</sup></a> was lost by the temerity of the Rathor
commander-in-chief, who might have crushed the rebellious
hopes of Aurangzeb, to whom he purposely gave time to effect a
junction with his brother Murad, from the vainglorious desire
“to conquer two princes at once.” Dearly did he pay for his
presumption; for he had given time to the wily prince to sow
intrigues in his camp, which were disclosed as soon as the battle
joined, when the Mogul horse deserted and left him at the head
of his thirty thousand Rajputs, deemed, however, by their leader
and themselves, sufficient against any odds. “Jaswant, spear
in hand, mounted his steed Mahbub, and charged the imperial
brothers; ten thousand Muslims fell in the onset, which cost
seventeen hundred Rathors [49], besides Guhilots, Haras, Gaurs,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_981'>981</span>and some of every clan of Rajwara. Aurang and Murad only
escaped because their days were not yet numbered. Mahbub
and his rider were covered with blood; Jasa looked like a famished
lion, and like one he relinquished his prey.” The bard is fully
confirmed in his relation of the day, both by the Mogul historian
and by Bernier, who says, that notwithstanding the immense
superiority of the imperial princes, aided by a numerous artillery
served by Frenchmen, night alone put a stop to the contest of
science, numbers, and artillery, against Rajput courage. Both
armies remained on the field of battle, and though we have no
notice of the anecdote related by the first translator of Ferishta,
who makes Jaswant “in bravado drive his car round the field,”<a id='r5.6.8' /><a href='#f5.6.8' class='c013'><sup>[8]</sup></a>
it is certain that Aurangzeb was too politic to renew the combat,
or molest the retreat which took place next day towards his native
dominions. Although, for the sake of alliteration, the bard
especially singles out the Guhilots and Gaurs, the tribes of Mewar
and Sheopur, all and every tribe was engaged; and if the Rajput
ever dared to mourn the fall of kindred in battle, this day should
have covered every house with the emblems of grief; for it is
stated by the Mogul historian that fifteen thousand fell, chiefly
Rajputs. This was one of the events glorious to the Rajput,
showing his devotion to whom fidelity (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>swamidharma</em></span>) had been
pledged—the aged and enfeebled emperor Shah Jahan, whose
“salt they ate”—against all the temptations offered by youthful
ambition. It is forcibly contrasted with the conduct of the
immediate household troops of the emperor, who, even in the
moment of battle, worshipped the rising sun, whilst the Rajput
sealed his faith in his blood; and none more liberally than the
brave Haras of Kotah and Bundi. The annals of no nation on
earth can furnish such an example, as an entire family, six royal
brothers, stretched on the field, and all but one in death.<a id='r5.6.9' /><a href='#f5.6.9' class='c013'><sup>[9]</sup></a></div>

<p class='c001'>Of all the deeds of heroism performed on this day, those of
Ratna of Ratlam, by universal consent, are pre-eminent, and
“are wreathed into immortal rhyme by the bard” in the Raesa
Rao Ratna.<a id='r5.6.10' /><a href='#f5.6.10' class='c013'><sup>[10]</sup></a> He also was a Rathor, the great-grandson of Udai
<span class='pageno' id='Page_982'>982</span>Singh, the first raja of Maru; and nobly did he show that the
Rathor blood had not degenerated on the fertile plains of Malwa.
If aught were wanting to complete the fame of this memorable
day, which gave empire to the scourge of Rajputana [50], it is
found in the conduct of Jaswant’s queen, who, as elsewhere
related,<a id='r5.6.11' /><a href='#f5.6.11' class='c013'><sup>[11]</sup></a> shut the gates of his capital on her fugitive lord, though
he “brought back his shield” and his honour.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Battle of Jājau.</h4>—Aurangzeb, on Jaswant’s retreat, entered the
capital of Malwa in triumph, whence, with all the celerity requisite
to success, he pursued his march on the capital. At the village
of Jajau, thirty miles south of Agra, the fidelity of the Rajputs
again formed a barrier between the aged king and the treason of
his son; but it served no other purpose than to illustrate this
fidelity. The Rajputs were overpowered, Dara was driven from
the regency, and the aged emperor deposed.<a id='r5.6.12' /><a href='#f5.6.12' class='c013'><sup>[12]</sup></a></div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Battle of Khajwa.</h4>—Aurangzeb, soon after usurping the throne,
sent, through the prince of Amber, his assurances of pardon to
Jaswant, and a summons to the presence, preparatory to joining
the army forming against his brother Shuja, advancing to vindicate
his claims to empire. The Rathor, deeming it a glorious
occasion for revenge, obeyed, and communicated to Shuja his
intentions. The hostile armies met at Khajwa, thirty miles
north of Allahabad.<a id='r5.6.13' /><a href='#f5.6.13' class='c013'><sup>[13]</sup></a> On the first onset, Jaswant, wheeling about
with his Rathor cavaliers, attacked the rearward of the army
under prince Muhammad, which he cut to pieces, and plundering
the imperial camp (left unprotected), he deliberately loaded his
camels with the most valuable effects, which he despatched under
part of the force, and leaving the brothers to a contest, which he
heartily wished might involve the destruction of both, he followed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_983'>983</span>the cortège to Agra. Such was the panic on his appearance at
that capital, joined to the rumours of Aurangzeb’s defeat, which
had nearly happened, that the wavering garrison required only a
summons to have surrendered, when he might have released Shah
Jahan from confinement, and with this “tower of strength” have
rallied an opposition fatal to the prince.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Policy of Jaswant Singh.</h4>—That this plan suggested itself to
Jaswant’s sagacity we cannot doubt; but besides the manifest
danger of locking up his army within the precincts of a capital,
if victory was given to Aurangzeb, he had other reasons for not
halting at Agra. All his designs were in concert with prince Dara,
the rightful heir to the throne, whom he had instructed to hasten
to the scene of action; but while Jaswant remained hovering in
the rear of Aurangzeb, momentarily expecting the junction of
the prince, the latter loitered on the southern frontier of Marwar,
and thus lost, for [51] ever, the crown within his grasp. Jaswant
continued his route to his native dominions, and had at least the
gratification of housing the spoils, even to the regal tents, in the
castle of Jodha. Dara tardily formed a junction at Merta; but
the critical moment was lost, and Aurangzeb, who had crushed
Shuja’s force, rapidly advanced, now joined by many of the
Rajput princes, to overwhelm this last remnant of opposition.
The crafty Aurangzeb, however, who always preferred stratagem
to the precarious issue of arms, addressed a letter to Jaswant, not
only assuring him of his entire forgiveness, but offering the vice-royalty
of Gujarat, if he would withdraw his support from Dara,
and remain neuter in the contest. Jaswant accepted the conditions,
and agreed to lead the Rajput contingents, under prince
Muazzam, in the war against Sivaji, bent on reviving the independence
of Maharashtra. From the conduct again pursued
by the Rathor, we have a right to infer that he only abandoned
Dara because, though possessed of many qualities which endeared
him to the Rajput, besides his title to the throne, he wanted those
virtues necessary to ensure success against his energetic brother.
Scarcely had Jaswant reached the Deccan when he opened a
communication with Sivaji, planned the death of the king’s
lieutenant, Shaista Khan, on which he hoped to have the guidance
of the army, and the young viceroy. Aurangzeb received
authentic intelligence of this plot, and the share Jaswant had in
it; but he temporized, and even sent letters of congratulation on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_984'>984</span>his succeeding to the command in chief. But he soon superseded
him by Raja Jai Singh of Amber, who brought the war to a conclusion
by the capture of Sivaji.<a id='r5.6.14' /><a href='#f5.6.14' class='c013'><sup>[14]</sup></a> The honour attending this
exploit was, however, soon exchanged for disgrace; for when the
Amber prince found that the tyrant had designs upon the life
of his prisoner, for whose safety he had pledged himself, he connived
at his escape.<a id='r5.6.15' /><a href='#f5.6.15' class='c013'><sup>[15]</sup></a> Upon this, Jaswant was once more declared
the emperor’s lieutenant, and soon inspired prince Muazzam with
designs, which again compelled the king to supersede him, and
Diler Khan was declared general-in-chief. He reached Aurangabad,
and the night of his arrival would have been his last, but he
received intimation and rapidly retreated, pursued by the prince
and Jaswant to the Nerbudda. The emperor saw the necessity
of removing Jaswant from this dangerous post, and he sent him
the farman as viceroy of Gujarat, to which he commanded him to
repair without delay. He obeyed, reached Ahmadabad, and
found the king had outwitted him and his [52] successor in command;
he therefore continued his course to his native dominions,
where he arrived in S. 1726 (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1670).</div>

<p class='c001'>The wily tyrant had, in all these changes, used every endeavour
to circumvent Jaswant, and, if the annals are correct, was little
scrupulous as to the means. But the Raja was protected by the
fidelity of his kindred vassalage. In the words of the bardic
chronicler, “The Aswapati,<a id='r5.6.16' /><a href='#f5.6.16' class='c013'><sup>[16]</sup></a> Aurang, finding treachery in vain,
put the collar of simulated friendship round his neck, and sent
him beyond the Attock to die.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The emperor saw that the only chance of counteracting
Jaswant’s inveterate hostility was to employ him where he would
be least dangerous. He gladly availed himself of a rebellion
amongst the Afghans of Kabul; and with many promises of
favour to himself and his family, appointed him to the chief
command,<a id='r5.6.17' /><a href='#f5.6.17' class='c013'><sup>[17]</sup></a> to lead his turbulent Rajputs against the equally
turbulent and almost savage Afghans. Leaving his elder son,
Prithi Singh, in charge of his ancestral domains, with his wives,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_985'>985</span>family, and the chosen bands of Maru, Jaswant departed for the
land of the “barbarian,” from which he was destined never to
return.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Treatment of Prithi Singh by Aurangzeb.</h4>—It is related, in the
chronicles of Maru, that Aurangzeb having commanded the
attendance at court of Jaswant’s heir, he obeyed, and was received
not only with the distinctions which were his due, but with the
most specious courtesy; that one day, with unusual familiarity,
the king desired him to advance, and grasping firmly his folded
hands (the usual attitude of deference) in one of his own, said,
“Well, Rathor, it is told me you possess as nervous an arm as
your father; what can you do now?” “God preserve your
majesty!” replied the Rajput prince, “when the sovereign of
mankind lays the hand of protection on the meanest of his
subjects, all his hopes are realized; but when he condescends to
take both of mine, I feel as if I could conquer the world.” His
vehement and animated gesture gave full force to his words, and
Aurangzeb quickly exclaimed, “Ah! here is another Khatan”<a id='r5.6.18' /><a href='#f5.6.18' class='c013'><sup>[18]</sup></a>
(the term he always applied to Jaswant); yet, affecting to be
pleased with the frank boldness of his speech, he ordered him a
splendid dress, which, as customary, he put on, and, having made
his obeisance, left the presence in the certain assurance of
exaltation.</div>

<p class='c001'>That day was his last!—he was taken ill soon after reaching
his quarters, and [53] expired in great torture, and to this hour
his death is attributed to the poisoned robe of honour presented
by the king.<a id='r5.6.19' /><a href='#f5.6.19' class='c013'><sup>[19]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Prithi Singh was the staff of his father’s age, and endowed with
all the qualities required to lead the swords of Maru. His death,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_986'>986</span>thus reported, cast a blight on the remaining days of Jaswant,
who, in this cruel stroke, saw that his mortal foe had gone beyond
him in revenge. The sacrifice of Prithi Singh was followed by the
death of his only remaining sons, Jagat Singh and Dalthamman,
from the ungenial climate of Kabul, and grief soon closed the
existence of the veteran Rathor. He expired amidst the mountains
of the north, without an heir to his revenge, in S. 1737
(<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1681), having ruled the tribes of Maru for two-and-forty
years. In this year, death released Aurangzeb from the greatest
terrors of his life; for the illustrious Sivaji and Jaswant paid the
debt to nature within a few months of each other.<a id='r5.6.20' /><a href='#f5.6.20' class='c013'><sup>[20]</sup></a> Of the
Rathor, we may use the words of the biographer of his contemporary,
Rana Raj Singh of Mewar: “Sighs never ceased
flowing from Aurang’s heart while Jaswant lived.”</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Character of Jaswant Singh.</h4>—The life of Jaswant Singh is one
of the most extraordinary in the annals of Rajputana, and a full
narrative of it would afford a perfect and deeply interesting
picture of the history and manners of the period. Had his
abilities, which were far above mediocrity, been commensurate
with his power, credit, and courage, he might, with the concurrent
aid of the many powerful enemies of Aurangzeb, have overturned
the Mogul throne. Throughout the long period of two-and-forty
years, events of magnitude crowded upon each other, from the
period of his first contest with Aurangzeb, in the battle of the
Nerbudda, to his conflicts with the Afghans amidst the snows of
Caucasus. Although the Rathor had a preference amongst the
sons of Shah Jahan, esteeming the frank Dara above the crafty
Aurangzeb, yet he detested the whole race as inimical to the
religion and the independence of his own; and he only fed the
hopes of any of the brothers, in their struggles for empire, expecting
that they would end in the ruin of all. His blind [54] arrogance
lost him the battle of the Nerbudda, and the supineness of Dara
prevented his reaping the fruit of his treachery at Khajwa. The
former event, as it reduced the means and lessened the fame of
Jaswant, redoubled his hatred to the conqueror. Jaswant
neglected no opportunity which gave a chance of revenge. Impelled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_987'>987</span>by this motive, more than by ambition, he never declined
situations of trust, and in each he disclosed the ruling passion of
his mind. His overture to Sivaji (like himself the implacable foe
of the Mogul), against whom he was sent to act; his daring
attempt to remove the imperial lieutenants, one by assassination,
the other by open force; his inciting Muazzam, whose inexperience
he was sent to guide, to revolt against his father, are some among
the many signal instances of Jaswant’s thirst for vengeance. The
emperor, fully aware of this hatred, yet compelled from the force
of circumstances to dissemble, was always on the watch to counteract
it, and the artifices this mighty king had recourse to in order
to conciliate Jaswant, perhaps to throw him off his guard, best
attest the dread in which he held him. Alternately he held the
vice-royalty of Gujarat, of the Deccan, of Malwa, Ajmer, and
Kabul (where he died), either directly of the king, or as the king’s
lieutenant, and second in command under one of the princes.
But he used all these favours merely as stepping-stones to the
sole object of his life. Accordingly, if Jaswant’s character had
been drawn by a biographer of the court, viewed merely in the
light of a great vassal of the empire, it would have reached us
marked with the stigma of treachery in every trust reposed in
him; but, on the other hand, when we reflect on the character
of the king, the avowed enemy of the Hindu faith, we only see in
Jaswant a prince putting all to hazard in its support. He had
to deal with one who placed him in these offices, not from personal
regard, but because he deemed a hollow submission better than
avowed hostility, and the raja, therefore, only opposed fraud to
hypocrisy, and treachery to superior strength. Doubtless the
Rathor was sometimes dazzled by the baits which the politic
king administered to his vanity; and when all his brother princes
eagerly contended for royal favour, it was something to be singled
out as the first amongst his peers in Rajputana. By such conflicting
impulses were both parties actuated in their mutual
conduct throughout a period in duration nearly equal to the life
of man; and it is no slight testimony to Aurangzeb’s skill in
managing such a subject, that he was able to neutralize the hatred
and the power of Jaswant throughout this lengthened [55] period.
But it was this vanity, and the immense power wielded by the
kings who could reward service by the addition of a vice-royalty
to their hereditary domains, that made the Rajput princes slaves;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_988'>988</span>for, had all the princely contemporaries of Jaswant—Jai Singh
of Amber, the Rana Raj of Mewar, and Sivaji—coalesced against
their national foe, the Mogul power must have been extinct.
Could Jaswant, however, have been satisfied with the mental
wounds he inflicted upon the tyrant, he would have had ample
revenge; for the image of the Rathor crossed all his visions of
aggrandizement. The cruel sacrifice of his heir, and the still
more barbarous and unrelenting ferocity with which he pursued
Jaswant’s innocent family, are the surest proofs of the dread
which the Rathor prince inspired while alive.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Tale of Nāhar Khān.</h4>—Previous, however, to entering on
this and the eventful period which followed Jaswant’s death, we
may record a few anecdotes illustrative of the character and
manners of the vassal chieftains, by whose aid he was thus
enabled to brave Aurangzeb. Nor can we do better than allow
Nahar Khan, chief of the Kumpawats and premier noble, to be
the representative portrait of the clans of Maru. It was by the
vigilance of this chief, and his daring intrepidity, that the many
plots laid for Jaswant’s life were defeated; and in the anecdote
already given, when in order to restore his prince from a fit of
mental delusion,<a id='r5.6.21' /><a href='#f5.6.21' class='c013'><sup>[21]</sup></a> he braved the superstitions of his race, his
devotion was put to a severer test than any which could result
from personal peril. The anecdote connected with his <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>nom de
guerre</em></span> of Nahar (<em>tiger</em>) Khan, exemplifies his personal, as the other
does his mental, intrepidity. The real name of this individual,
the head of the Kumpawat clan, was Mukunddas. He had
personally incurred the displeasure of the emperor, by a reply
which was deemed disrespectful to a message sent by the royal
Ahadi,<a id='r5.6.22' /><a href='#f5.6.22' class='c013'><sup>[22]</sup></a> for which the tyrant condemned him to enter a tiger’s
den, and contend for his life unarmed. Without a sign of fear
he entered the arena, where the savage beast was pacing, and thus
contemptuously accosted him: “Oh, tiger of the Miyan,<a id='r5.6.23' /><a href='#f5.6.23' class='c013'><sup>[23]</sup></a> face
the tiger of Jaswant”; exhibiting to the king of the forest a
pair of eyes, which anger and opium had rendered little less inflamed
than his own. The animal, startled by so unaccustomed
a salutation, for a moment looked at his visitor, put down his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_989'>989</span>head, turned round and [56] stalked from him. “You see,”
exclaimed the Rathor, “that he dare not face me, and it is
contrary to the creed of a true Rajput to attack an enemy who
dares not confront him.” Even the tyrant, who beheld the
scene, was surprised into admiration, presented him with gifts,
and asked if he had any children to inherit his prowess. His
reply, “How can we get children, when you keep us from our
wives beyond the Attock?” fully shows that the Rathor and fear
were strangers to each other. From this singular encounter he
bore the name of Nahar Khan, ‘the tiger lord.’</div>

<p class='c001'>On another occasion, from the same freedom of speech, he
incurred the displeasure of the Shahzada, or prince-royal, who,
with youthful levity, commanded the ‘tiger lord’ to attempt a
feat which he deemed inconsistent with his dignity, namely,
gallop at speed under a horizontal branch of a tree and cling to it
while the steed passed on. This feat, requiring both agility and
strength, appears to have been a common amusement, and it is
related in the Annals of Mewar that the chief of Banera broke
his spine in the attempt; and there were few who did not come
off with bruises and falls, in which consisted the sport. When
Nahar heard the command, he indignantly replied, he “was not
a monkey”; that “if the prince wished to see his feats, it must
be where his sword had play”; on which he was ordered against
Surthan, the Deora prince of Sirohi, for which service he had the
whole Rathor contingent at his disposal. The Deora prince, who
could not attempt to cope against it in the field, took to his
native hills; but while he deemed himself secure, Mukund, with
a chosen band, in the dead of night, entered the glen where the
Sirohi prince reposed, stabbed the solitary sentinel, bound the
prince with his own turban to his pallet, while, environing him
with his clansmen, he gave the alarm. The Deoras starting from
their rocky beds, collected round their prince, and were preparing
for the rescue, when Nahar called aloud, “You see his life is in
my hands; be assured it is safe if you are wise; but he dies on
the least opposition to my determination to convey him to my
prince. My sole object in giving the alarm was that you might
behold me carry off my prize.” He conveyed Surthan to Jaswant,
who said he must introduce him to the king. The Deora prince
was carried to court, and being led between the proper officers
to the palace, he was instructed to perform that profound
<span class='pageno' id='Page_990'>990</span>obeisance, from which none were exempted. But the haughty
Deora replied, “His life was in the king’s hands, his [57] honour
in his own; he had never bowed the head to mortal man, and
never would.” As Jaswant had pledged himself for his honourable
treatment, the officers of the ceremonies endeavoured by
stratagem to obtain a constrained obeisance, and instead of
introducing him as usual, they showed him a wicket, knee high,
and very low overhead, by which to enter, but putting his feet
foremost, his head was the last part to appear.<a id='r5.6.24' /><a href='#f5.6.24' class='c013'><sup>[24]</sup></a> This stubborn
ingenuity, his noble bearing, and his long-protracted resistance,
added to Jaswant’s pledge, won the king’s favour; and he not
only proffered him pardon, but whatever lands he might desire.
Though the king did not name the return, Surthan was well
aware of the terms, but he boldly and quickly replied, “What
can your majesty bestow equal to Achalgarh? let me return to
it is all I ask.” The king had the magnanimity to comply with
his request; Surthan was allowed to retire to the castle of Abu,<a id='r5.6.25' /><a href='#f5.6.25' class='c013'><sup>[25]</sup></a>
nor did he or any of the Deoras ever rank themselves amongst
the vassals of the empire; but they have continued to the present
hour a life of almost savage independence.</p>

<p class='c001'>From such anecdotes we learn the character of the tiger lord
of Asop; and his brother Rathors of Marwar; men reckless of
life when put in competition with distinction and fidelity to their
prince, as will be abundantly illustrated in the reign we are
about to describe.</p>

to burn with her lord, but being in the seventh month of
her pregnancy, she was forcibly prevented by Uda Kumpawat.

and as soon as the tidings reached Jodhpur, the Chandravati
queen, taking a turban of her late lord, ascended the pile at

of their faith. The bells of the temple were mute; the sacred
shell no longer sounded at sunrise; the Brahmans vitiated their
doctrines and learned the Muslim creed.”<a id='r5.7.1' /><a href='#f5.7.1' class='c013'><sup>[1]</sup></a></div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Birth of Ajīt Singh.</h4>—The queen was delivered of a boy, who
received the name of Ajit. As soon as she was able to travel,
the Rathor contingent, with their infant prince, his mother, the
daughters, and establishment of their late sovereign, prepared
to return to their native land. But the unrelenting tyrant,
carrying his vengeance towards Jaswant even beyond the grave,
as soon they reached Delhi, commanded that the infant should
be surrendered to his custody. “Aurang offered to divide Maru
amongst [59] them if they would surrender their prince; but
they replied, ‘Our country is with our sinews, and these can
defend both it and our Lord.’ With eyes red with rage, they
left the Amm-khass. Their abode was surrounded by the host of
the Shah. In a basket of sweetmeats they sent away the young
prince, and prepared to defend their honour; they made oblations
to the gods, took a double portion of opium, and mounted their
steeds. Then spoke Ranchhor, and Govind the son of Jodha,
and Chandarbhan the Darawat, and the son of Raghu, on whose
shoulders the sword had been married at Ujjain, with the fearless
Baharmall the Udawat, and the Sujawat, Raghunath. ‘Let
us swim,’ they exclaimed, ‘in the ocean of fight. Let us root
up these Asuras, and be carried by the Apsaras to the mansions
of the sun.’ As thus each spoke, Suja the bard took the word:
‘For a day like this,’ said he, ‘you enjoy your fiefs (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>pattas</em></span>), to
give in your lord’s cause your bodies to the sword, and in one
mass to gain <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>swarga</em></span> (heaven). As for me, who enjoyed his friendship
and his gifts, this day will I make his salt resplendent. My
father’s fame will I uphold, and lead the death in this day’s fight,
that future bards may hymn my praise.’ Then spake Durga,
son of Asa: ‘The teeth of the Yavans are whetted, but by the
lightning emitted from our swords, Delhi shall witness our deeds;
and the flame of our anger shall consume the troops of the Shah.’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_992'>992</span>As thus the chiefs communed, and the troops of the king
approached, the Rajloka<a id='r5.7.2' /><a href='#f5.7.2' class='c013'><sup>[2]</sup></a> of their late lord was sent to inhabit
Swarga. Lance in hand, with faces resembling Yama,<a id='r5.7.3' /><a href='#f5.7.3' class='c013'><sup>[3]</sup></a> the
Rathors rushed upon the foe. Then the music of swords and
shields commenced. Wave followed wave in the field of blood.
Sankara<a id='r5.7.4' /><a href='#f5.7.4' class='c013'><sup>[4]</sup></a> completed his chaplet in the battle fought by the
children of Duhar in the streets of Delhi. Ratna contended with
nine thousand of the foe; but his sword failed, and as he fell,
Rambha<a id='r5.7.5' /><a href='#f5.7.5' class='c013'><sup>[5]</sup></a> carried him away. Dila the Darawat made a gift of
his life;<a id='r5.7.6' /><a href='#f5.7.6' class='c013'><sup>[6]</sup></a> the salt of his lord he mixed with the water of the

Chandrapur.<a id='r5.7.8' /><a href='#f5.7.8' class='c013'><sup>[8]</sup></a> The Bhatti was cut piecemeal and lay on the
field beside the son of Surthan. The faithful Udawat appeared
like the crimson lotus; he journeyed to Swarga to visit Jaswant.
Sanda the bard, with a sword in either hand, was in the front
of the battle, and gained the mansion of the moon.<a id='r5.7.9' /><a href='#f5.7.9' class='c013'><sup>[9]</sup></a> Every tribe

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Johar.</h4>—When these brave men saw that nothing short
of the surrender of all that was dear to a Rajput was intended
<span class='pageno' id='Page_993'>993</span>by the fiend-like spirit of the king, their first thought was the
preservation of their prince; the next to secure their own honour
and that of their late master. The means by which they accomplished
this were terrific. The females of the deceased, together
with their own wives and daughters, were placed in an apartment
filled with gunpowder, and the torch applied—all was soon over.
This sacrifice accomplished, their sole thought was to secure a
niche in that immortal temple, which the Rajput bard, as well
as the great minstrel of the west, peoples with “youths who died,
to be by poets sung.” For this, the Rajput’s anxiety has in all
ages been so great, as often to defeat even the purpose of revenge,
his object being to die gloriously rather than to inflict death;
assured that his name would never perish, but, preserved in
“immortal rhyme” by the bard, would serve as the incentive
to similar deeds. Accordingly, “the battle fought by the sons
of Duharia<a id='r5.7.11' /><a href='#f5.7.11' class='c013'><sup>[11]</sup></a> in the streets of Delhi” is one of the many themes
of everlasting eulogy to the Rathors; and the seventh of Sravan,
S. 1736 (the second month of the Monsoon of <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1680), is a
sacred day in the calendar of Maru.</div>

<p class='c001'>In the midst of this furious contest, the infant prince was
saved. To avoid suspicion the heir of Maru, concealed in a basket
of sweetmeats, was entrusted to a Muslim, who religiously executed
his trust and conveyed him to the appointed spot, where he was
joined by the gallant Durgadas with the survivors who had cut
their way through all opposition, and who were doomed often
to bleed for the prince thus miraculously preserved. It is pleasing
to find that if to “the leader [61] of the faithful,” the bigoted
Aurangzeb, they owed so much misery, to one (and he of humble
life), of the same faith, they owed the preservation of their line.
The preserver of Ajit lived to witness his manhood and the redemption
of his birthright, and to find that princes are not always
ungrateful; for he was distinguished at court, was never addressed
but as <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>Kaka</em></span>, or uncle, by the prince; and to the honour of his
successors be it told, the lands then settled upon him are still
enjoyed by his descendants.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Youth of Ajīt Singh. Campaign of Aurangzeb in Mārwār.</h4>—With
the sole surviving scion of Jaswant, the faithful Durga
<span class='pageno' id='Page_994'>994</span>and a few chosen friends repaired to the isolated rock of Abu,
and placed him in a monastery of recluses. There the heir of
Maru was reared in entire ignorance of his birth. Still rumours
prevailed, that a son of Jaswant lived; that Durga and a few
associates were his guardians; and this was enough for the
loyal Rajput, who, confiding in the chieftain of Dunara, allowed
the mere name of Dhani (lord) to be his rallying-word in the
defence of his rights. These were soon threatened by a host of
enemies, amongst whom were the Indhas, the ancient sovereigns
of Maru, who saw an opening for the redemption of their birthright,
and for a short time displayed the flag of the Parihars on
the walls of Mandor. While the Indhas were rejoicing at the
recovery of their ancient capital, endeared to them by tradition,
an attempt was made by Ratna,<a id='r5.7.12' /><a href='#f5.7.12' class='c013'><sup>[12]</sup></a> the son of Amra Singh (whose
tragical death has been related), to obtain the seat of power,
Jodhpur. This attempt, instigated by the king, proved futile;
and the clans, faithful to the memory of Jaswant and the name
of Ajit, soon expelled the Indhas from Mandor, and drove the
son of Amra to his castle of Nagor. It was then that Aurangzeb,
in person, led his army into Maru; the capital was invested;
it fell and was pillaged, and all the great towns in the plains, as
Merta, Didwana, and Rohat, shared a similar fate. The emblems
of religion were trampled under foot, the temples thrown down,
mosques were erected on their site, and nothing short of the
compulsory conversion to the tenets of Islam of every Rajput
in Marwar would satisfy his revenge.<a id='r5.7.13' /><a href='#f5.7.13' class='c013'><sup>[13]</sup></a> The consequences of this
fanatical and impolitic conduct recoiled not only upon the emperor
but his whole race, for it roused an opposition to this iron yoke,
which ultimately broke it in pieces. The emperor promulgated
that famous edict, the Jizya, against the whole Hindu race,
which cemented into one compact union all who cherished either
patriotism or religion. It was at this period of time, when the
Rathors and Sesodias united [62] against the tyrant, that Rana</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_995'>995</span>Raj Singh indited that celebrated epistle, which is given in a
preceding part of this work.<a id='r5.7.14' /><a href='#f5.7.14' class='c013'><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>“Seventy thousand men,” says the bard,<a id='r5.7.15' /><a href='#f5.7.15' class='c013'><sup>[15]</sup></a> “under Tahawwur
Khan, were commanded to destroy the Rajputs, and Aurang
followed in person to Ajmer. The Mertia clan assembled, and
advanced to Pushkar to oppose him. The battle was in front
of the temple of Varaha, where the swords of the Mertias, always
first in the fight, played the game of destruction on the heads of
the Asuras. Here the Mertias were all slain on the 11th Bhadon,
S. 1736.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Tahawwur continued to advance. The inhabitants of
Murdhar fled to the mountains. At Gura the brothers Rupa
and Kumbha took post with their clan to oppose him; but they
fell with twenty-five of their brethren. As the cloud pours water
<span class='pageno' id='Page_996'>996</span>upon the earth, so did Aurang pour his barbarians over the land.
He remained but five days at Ajaidurg (Ajmer), and marched
against Chitor. It fell: it appeared as if the heavens had fallen.
Ajit was protected by the Rana, and the Rathors led the van in
the host of the Sesodias. Seeing the strength of the Yavans,
they shut up the young prince, like a flame confined in a vessel.
Delhipat (the king of Delhi) came to Debari,<a id='r5.7.16' /><a href='#f5.7.16' class='c013'><sup>[16]</sup></a> at whose pass he
was opposed by Kumbha, Ugarsen, and Uda, all Rathors. While
Aurangzeb attacked Udaipur, Azam was left at Chitor. Then
the king learned that Durgadas had invaded Jalor; he abandoned
his conquest, and returned to Ajmer, sending Mukarrab Khan
to aid Bihari at Jalor; but Durga had raised contributions [63]
(<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>dand</em></span>), and passed to Jodhpur, alike forced to contribute; for
the son of Indar Singh, on the part of the king, now commanded
in Trikuta (triple-peaked mount). Aurang Shah measured the
heavens; he determined to have but one faith in the land.
Prince Akbar was sent to join Tahawwur Khan. Rapine and
conflagration spread over the land. The country became a
waste; fear stalked triumphant. Providence had willed this
affliction. The Indhas were put in possession of Jodhpur; but
were encountered at Ketapur and put to the sword by the Champawats.
Once more they lost the title of Raos of Murdardes,
and thus the king’s intentions of bestowing sovereignty on the
Parihars were frustrated on the 13th day of Jeth, S. 1736.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Retreat of the Rathors.</h4>—“The Aravalli gave shelter to the

while Aurang’s was seldom invoked. The king gave up the war
against the Rana to send all his troops into Maru; but the Rana,
who provoked the rage of Aurang from granting refuge to Ajit,
sent his troops under his own son, Bhim, who joined the Rathors,
led by Indarbhan and Durgadas in Godwar. Prince Akbar and
Tahawwur Khan advanced upon them, and a battle took place
<span class='pageno' id='Page_997'>997</span>at Nadol. The Sesodias had the right. The combat was long
and bloody. Prince Bhim fell at the head of the Mewaris: he
was a noble bulwark to the Rathors.<a id='r5.7.19' /><a href='#f5.7.19' class='c013'><sup>[19]</sup></a> Indarbhan was slain,

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Rebellion of Prince Akbar, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1681.</h4>—The gallant bearing
of the Rajputs in this unequal combat, their desperate devotion
to their country and prince, touched the soul of Prince Akbar,
who had the magnanimity to commiserate the sufferings he was
compelled to inflict, and to question the policy of his father
towards these gallant vassals. Ambition came to the aid of
compassion for the sufferings of the Rathors, and the persecution
of the minor son of Jaswant. He opened his mind to Tahawwur
Khan, and exposed the [64] disgrace of bearing arms in so unholy
a warfare, and in severing from the crown such devoted and
brave vassals as the Rathors. Tahawwur was gained over, and
an embassy sent to Durgadas offering peace, and expressing a
wish for a conference. Durga convened the chiefs, and disclosed
the overture; but some suspected treachery in the prince, others
selfish views on the part of Durga. To prevent the injurious
operation of such suspicions, Durga observed, that if assent
were not given to the meeting, it would be attributed to the base
motive of fear. “Let us proceed in a body,” said he, “to this
conference; who ever heard of a cloud being caught?” They
met; mutual views were developed; a treaty was concluded,
and the meeting ended by Akbar waving the umbrella of regality
over his head.<a id='r5.7.20' /><a href='#f5.7.20' class='c013'><sup>[20]</sup></a> He coined in his own name; he established his
own weights and measures. The poisoned intelligence was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_998'>998</span>poured into Aurang’s ear at Ajmer; his soul was troubled; he
had no rest; he plucked his beard in grief when he heard that
Durga and Akbar had united. Every Rathor in the land flocked
to Akbar’s standard. The house of Delhi was divided, and
Govind<a id='r5.7.21' /><a href='#f5.7.21' class='c013'><sup>[21]</sup></a> again supported the Hindu faith.</div>

<p class='c001'>The dethronement of the tyrant appeared inevitable. The
scourge of the Rajputs was in their power, for he was almost alone
and without the hope of succour. But his energies never forsook
him; he knew the character of his foes, and that on an emergency
his grand auxiliary, stratagem, was equal to an army. As there
is some variation both in the Mogul historian’s account of this
momentous transaction and in the annals of Mewar and Marwar,<a id='r5.7.22' /><a href='#f5.7.22' class='c013'><sup>[22]</sup></a>
we present the latter <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>verbatim</em></span> from the chronicle.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Akbar, with multitudes of Rajputs, advanced upon Ajmer.
But while Aurang prepared for the storm, the prince gave himself
up to women and the song, placing everything in the hands of
Tahawwur Khan. We are the slaves of fate; puppets that
dance as it pulls the strings. Tahawwur allowed himself to dream
of treason; it was whispered in his ear that if he could deliver
Akbar to his father, high rewards would follow. At night he
went privily to Aurangzeb, and thence wrote to the Rathors:
‘I was the bond of union betwixt you and Akbar, but the dam
which separated the waters has broken down. Father and son
again are one. Consider the pledges, given and received, as
restored, and depart for your own lands.’ Having sealed this
with his signet, and dispatched a messenger to the Rathors,
he appeared before Aurangzeb to receive the fruit of his service.
But his treason met its [65] reward, and before he could say, the
imperial orders were obeyed, a blow of the mace from the hand
of the monarch sent his soul to hell. At midnight the Dervesh
messenger reached the Rathor camp; he put the letter into
their hand, which stated father and son were united; and added
from himself that Tahawwur Khan was slain. All was confusion;
the Rathors saddled and mounted, and moved a coss from Akbar’s
camp. The panic spread to his troops, who fled like the dried
leaves of the sugar-cane when carried up in a whirlwind, while
the prince was attending to the song and the wiles of the wanton.”</p>

<div class='section-start'><span class='pageno' id='Page_999'>999</span><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Rāthors abandon Akbar.</h4>—This narrative exemplifies most
strongly the hasty unreflecting character of the Rajput, who
always acts from the impulse of the moment. They did not even
send to Akbar’s camp, although close to their own, to inquire the
truth or falsehood of the report, but saddled and did not halt
until they were twenty miles asunder. It is true, that in these
times of peril they did not know in whom to confide; and being
headed by one of their own body, they could not tell how far he
might be implicated in the treachery.</div>

<p class='c001'>The next day they were undeceived by the junction of the
prince, who, when made acquainted with the departure of his
allies, and the treason and death of Tahawwur Khan, could scarcely
collect a thousand men to abide by his fortunes. With these he
followed his panic-struck allies, and threw himself and his family
upon their hospitality and protection—an appeal never made in
vain to the Rajput. The poetic account, by the bard Karnidhan,
of the reception of the prince by the chivalry of Maru, is remarkably
minute and spirited:—the warriors and senators enter into
a solemn debate as to the conduct to be pursued to the prince
now claiming <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>saran</em></span> (sanctuary), when the bard takes occasion
to relate the pedigree and renown of the chiefs of every clan.
Each chief delivers his sentiments in a speech full of information
respecting their national customs and manners. It also displays
a good picture of “the power of the swans, and the necessity of
feeding them with pearls,” to enable them to sing with advantage.
The council breaks up with the declaration of its determination
to protect Akbar at all hazards, and Jetha, the brother of the
head of the Champawats, is nominated to the charge of protector
of Akbar’s family. The gallant Durga, the Ulysses of the Rathors,
is the manager of this dramatic convention, the details of which
are wound up with an eulogy in true oriental hyperbole, in the
Doric accents of Maru: [66]—</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Character of Durgadās.</h4>—This model of a Rajput, as wise as
he was brave, was the saviour of his country. To his suggestion
it owed the preservation of its prince, and to a series of heroic
deeds, his subsequent and more difficult salvation. Many anecdotes
are extant recording the dread Aurangzeb had of this leader
of the Rathors, one of which is amusing. The tyrant had commanded
pictures to be drawn of two of the most mortal foes to
his repose, Sivaji and Durga: “Siva was drawn seated on a
couch; Durga in his ordinary position, on horseback, toasting
<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>bātis</em></span> or barley-cakes, with the point of his lance, on a fire of
maize-stalks. Aurangzeb, at the first glance, exclaimed, ‘I may
entrap that fellow (meaning Sivaji), but this dog is born to be
my bane.s’”</div>

<p class='c001'>Durga at the head of his bands, together with young Akbar,
moved towards the western extremity of the State, in hopes that
they might lead the emperor in pursuit amongst the sandhills
of the Luni; but the wily monarch tried other arts, and first
attempted to corrupt Durga. He sent him eight thousand gold
mohurs,<a id='r5.7.24' /><a href='#f5.7.24' class='c013'><sup>[24]</sup></a> which the Rajput instantly applied to the necessities
of Akbar, who was deeply affected at this proof of devotion,
and distributed a portion of it amongst Durga’s retainers.
Aurangzeb, seeing the futility of this plan, sent a force in pursuit
of his son, who, knowing he had no hope of mercy if he fell into
his father’s hands, was anxious to place distance between them.
Durga pledged himself for his safety, and relinquished all to
ensure it. Making over the guardianship of young Ajit to his
elder brother, Soning, and placing himself at the head of one
thousand chosen men, he turned towards the south. The bard
enumerates the names and families of all the chieftains of note
who formed the bodyguard of prince Akbar in this desperate
undertaking. The Champawats were the most numerous, but
he specifies several of the home clans, as the Jodha and Mertia,
and amongst the foreign Rajputs, the Jadon, Chauhan, Bhatti,
Deora, Sonigira, and Mangalia [67].</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Escape of Prince Akbar.</h4>—“The king followed their retreat:
his troops surrounded the Rathors; but Durga with one thousand
chosen men left the north on their backs, and with the speed of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1001'>1001</span>the winged quitted the camp. Aurang continued the pursuit
to Jalor, when he found he had been led on a wrong scent, and
that Durga, with the prince, keeping Gujarat on his right, and
Chappan<a id='r5.7.25' /><a href='#f5.7.25' class='c013'><sup>[25]</sup></a> on his left, had made good his retreat to the Nerbudda.
Rage so far got the better of his religion, that he threw the Koran
at the head of the Almighty. In wrath, he commanded Azam
to exterminate the Rathors, but to leave Udaipur on one side,<a id='r5.7.26' /><a href='#f5.7.26' class='c013'><sup>[26]</sup></a>
and every other design, and first secure his brother. The deeds
of Kamunda<a id='r5.7.27' /><a href='#f5.7.27' class='c013'><sup>[27]</sup></a> removed the troubles of Mewar, as the wind
disperses the clouds which shade the brightness of the moon.

leaving his garrisons in Jodhpur and Ajmer. Durga’s name was

who never left the person of Ajit, when his infancy was concealed

of the Nine Castles of Maru knew that he was concealed; but
where or in whose custody all were ignorant. Some thought he
was at Jaisalmer; others at Bikampur; others at Sirohi. The
eight divisions nobly supported the days of their exile; their
sinews sustained the land of Murdhar. Raos, Rajas, and Ranas
applauded their deeds, for all were alike enveloped in the net of
destruction. In all the nine thousand [towns] of Murdhar, and
the ten thousand of Mewar,<a id='r5.7.30' /><a href='#f5.7.30' class='c013'><sup>[30]</sup></a> inhabitants there were none. Inayat

more collected their clans and kin, and as soon as they heard that
the king was within four coss of Ajmer they blockaded the Khan
[68] in the city of Jodha; but twenty thousand Moguls came to
the rescue. Another dreadful conflict ensued at the gates of
Jodhpur, in which the Jadon Kishor, who led the battle, and
many other chiefs were slain, yet not without many hundreds of
the foe; the 9th Asarh, S. 1737.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Soning carried the sword and the flame into every quarter.
Aurang could neither advance nor retreat. He was like the
serpent seizing the musk-rat, which, if liberated, caused blindness;
but if swallowed, was like poison. Harnath and Kana
Singh took the road to Sojat. They surrounded and drove away
the cattle, which brought the Asurs to the rescue. A dreadful
strife ensued; the chief of the Asurs was slain, but the brothers
and all their kin bedewed the land with their blood. This, the
<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>sakha</em></span> of Sojat, was when 1737 ended and 1738 commenced,
when the sword and the pestilence (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>mari</em></span><a id='r5.7.32' /><a href='#f5.7.32' class='c013'><sup>[32]</sup></a>) united to clear the
land.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1003'>1003</span>“Soning was the Rudra of the field; Agra and Delhi trembled
at his deeds; he looked on Aurang as the waning moon. The
king sent an embassy to Soning; it was peace he desired. He
offered the mansab of Sat Hazari for Ajit,<a id='r5.7.33' /><a href='#f5.7.33' class='c013'><sup>[33]</sup></a> and what dignities
he might demand for his brethren—the restoration of Ajmer,
and to make Soning its governor. To the engagement was added,
‘the panja is affixed in ratification of this treaty, witnessed by
God Almighty.’<a id='r5.7.34' /><a href='#f5.7.34' class='c013'><sup>[34]</sup></a> The Diwan, Asad Khan, was the negotiator,
and the Aremdi,<a id='r5.7.35' /><a href='#f5.7.35' class='c013'><sup>[35]</sup></a> who was with him, solemnly swore to its maintenance.
The treaty concluded, the king, whose thoughts could
not be diverted from Akbar, departed for the Deccan. Asad
Khan was left at Ajmer, and Soning at Merta [69]. But Soning
was a thorn in the side of Aurangzeb; he bribed the Brahmans,
who threw pepper into the Homa (burnt sacrifice) and secured
for Soning a place in Suraj Mandala (the mansion of the sun).
The day following the treaty, by the incantations of Auranga,
Soning was no more.<a id='r5.7.36' /><a href='#f5.7.36' class='c013'><sup>[36]</sup></a> Asoj the 6th, S. 1738.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Asad sent the news to the king. This terror being removed,
the king withdrew his <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>panja</em></span> from his treaty, and in joy departed
for the Deccan. The death of Soning shed gloom and grief over
the land. Then Mukund Singh Mertia, son of Kalyan, abandoned
his mansab and joined his country’s cause. A desperate encounter
soon followed with the troops of Asad Khan near Merta, in which
Ajit, the son of Bitaldas, who led the fight, was slain, with many
of each clan, which gave joy to the Asurs, but grief to the faithful
Rajput; on the second day of the bright half of the moon of
Kartik, S. 1738.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Prince Azam was left with Asad Khan; Inayat at Jodhpur;
and their garrisons were scattered over the land, as their tombs
(<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>gor</em></span>) everywhere attest. The lord of Chandawal, Shambhu
Kumpawat, now led the Rathors with Udang Singh Bakhshi,
and Tejsi, the young son of Durga, the bracelet on the arm of
Mahadeva, with Fateh Singh and Ram Singh, just returned from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1004'>1004</span>placing Akbar safely in the Deccan, and many other valiant
Rathors.<a id='r5.7.37' /><a href='#f5.7.37' class='c013'><sup>[37]</sup></a> They spread over the country even to Mewar, sacked
Pur-Mandal, and slew the governor Kasim Khan.”</p>

<p class='c001'>These desultory and bloody affrays, though they kept the
king’s troops in perpetual alarm and lost them myriads of men,
thinned the ranks of the defenders of Maru, who again took
refuge in the Aravalli. From thence, watching every opportunity,
they darted on their prey. On one occasion they fell upon the
garrison of Jaitaran, which they routed and expelled, or as the
chronicle quaintly says, “with the year 1739 they also fled.”
At the same time, the post of Sojat was carried by Bija Champawat,
while the Jodhawats, under Ram Singh, kept their foes in
play to the northward, and led by Udaibhan attacked the Mirza
Nur Ali at Charai: “the contest lasted for three hours; the
dead bodies of the Yavans lay in heaps in the Akhara; who
even abandoned their Nakkaras.”<a id='r5.7.38' /><a href='#f5.7.38' class='c013'><sup>[38]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>“After the affair of Jaitaran, when Udai Singh Champawat
and Mohkam Singh Mertia were the leaders, they made a push
for Gujarat, and had penetrated to [70] Kheralu,<a id='r5.7.39' /><a href='#f5.7.39' class='c013'><sup>[39]</sup></a> when they
were attacked, pursued, and surrounded in the hills at Renpur,
by Sayyid Muhammad, the Hakim of Gujarat. All night they
stood to their arms. In the morning the sword rained and filled
the cars of the Apsaras. Karan and Kesari were slain, with
Gokuldas Bhatti, with all their civil officers, and Ram Singh
himself renounced life on this day.<a id='r5.7.40' /><a href='#f5.7.40' class='c013'><sup>[40]</sup></a> But the Asurs pulled up
the reins, having lost many men. Pali was also attacked in the
month of Bhadon this year 1739; then the game of destruction
was played with Nur Ali, three hundred Rathors against five
hundred of the king’s troops, which were routed, losing their
leader, Afzal Khan, after a desperate struggle.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Bala was the hero who drove the Yavan from this post.
Udaya attacked the Sidi at Sojat. Jaitaran was again reinforced.
In Baisakh, Mohkam Singh Mertia attacked the royal post at
Merta, slew Sayyid Ali, and drove out the king’s troops.”</p>

<div class='section-start'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1005'>1005</span><h4 class='disp-inline'>Assistance given by the Bhattis.</h4>—The year 1739 was one of
perpetual conflict, of captures and recaptures, in which many
parties of twenty and thirty on each side fell. They afford
numerous examples of heroic patriotism, in which Rathor blood
was lavishly shed; but while to them each warrior was a loss not
to be replaced, the despot continued to feed the war with fresh
troops. The Bhattis of Jaisalmer came forward this year, and
nobly shed their blood in seconding the efforts of the Rathors in
this patriotic warfare.</div>

<p class='c001'>“In S. 1740, Azam and Asad Khan joined the emperor in
the Deccan, and Inayat Khan was left in command at Ajmer—being
enjoined not to relax the war in Marwar, even with the
setting in of the rains. Merwara afforded a place of rendezvous
for the Rathors, and security for their families. Here eleven
thousand of the best troops of Inayat invaded the hills to attack
the united Jodhas and Champawats, who retaliated on Pali,
Sojat, and Godwar. The ancient Mandor, which was occupied
by a garrison under Khwaja Salah, was attacked by the Mandecha
Bhatti and driven out. At Bagri, a desperate encounter took
place in the month of Baisakh, when Ram Singh and Samant
Singh, both Bhatti chiefs, fell, with two hundred of their vassals,
slaying one thousand of the Moguls. The Karamsots and Kumpawats,
under Anup Singh, scoured the banks of the Luni, and put
to the sword the garrisons of Ustara and Gangani. Mohkam,
with his Mertias, made a descent on his patrimonial lands, and
drew upon him the whole force of its [71] governor, Muhammad Ali.
The Mertias met him on their own native plains. The Yavan
proposed a truce, and at the interview assassinated the head of the
Mertias, tidings of whose death rejoiced the Shah in the Deccan.</p>

<p class='c001'>“At the beginning of 1741, neither strife nor fear had abated.
Sujan Singh led the Rathors in the south, while Lakha Champawat
and Kesar Kumpawat, aided by the Bhattis and Chauhans,
kept the garrison of Jodhpur in alarm. When Sujan was slain,
the bard was sent to Sangram, who held a mansab and lands from
the king; he was implored to join his brethren; he obeyed, and
all collected around Sangram.<a id='r5.7.41' /><a href='#f5.7.41' class='c013'><sup>[41]</sup></a> Siwancha<a id='r5.7.42' /><a href='#f5.7.42' class='c013'><sup>[42]</sup></a> was attacked, and
with Bhalotra and Panchbhadra were plundered; while the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1006'>1006</span>blockaded garrisons were unable to aid. An hour before sunset
every gate of Maru was shut. The Asurs had the strongholds
in their power; but the plains resounded with the An<a id='r5.7.43' /><a href='#f5.7.43' class='c013'><sup>[43]</sup></a> of Ajit.
Udaibhan, with his Jodhawats, appeared before Bhadrajun; he
assaulted the foe and captured his guns and treasure. An attempt
from Jodhpur made to recapture the trophies, added to the
triumph of the Jodha.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Abduction of the Asāni Girls.</h4>—“Purdil Khan<a id='r5.7.44' /><a href='#f5.7.44' class='c013'><sup>[44]</sup></a> held Siwana;
and Nahar Khan Mewati, Kunari. To attack them, the Champawats
convened at Mokalsar. Their thirst for vengeance redoubled
at the tidings that Nur Ali had abducted two young women of
the tribe of Asani. Ratna led the Rathors; they reached
Kunari and engaged Purdil Khan, who was put to the sword
with six hundred of his men. The Rathors left one hundred in
the field that day, the ninth of Chait. The Mirza<a id='r5.7.45' /><a href='#f5.7.45' class='c013'><sup>[45]</sup></a> no sooner
heard of this defeat than he fled towards Toda, with the Asani
damsels, gazing on the mangoes as they ripened, and having
reached Kuchal, he encamped. Subhal Singh, the son of Askaran,
heard it; he took his opium, and though the Mirza was surrounded
by pillars, the dagger of Askaran’s son reached his heart; but
the Bhatti<a id='r5.7.46' /><a href='#f5.7.46' class='c013'><sup>[46]</sup></a> was cut in pieces. The roads were now impassable;
the Thanas<a id='r5.7.47' /><a href='#f5.7.47' class='c013'><sup>[47]</sup></a> of the Yavans were reduced to great straits [72].</div>

<p class='c001'>“The year 1742 commenced with the slaughter of the king’s
garrison at Sambhar by the Lakhawats and Asawats;<a id='r5.7.48' /><a href='#f5.7.48' class='c013'><sup>[48]</sup></a> while
from Godwar the chiefs made incursions to the gates of Ajmer.
A battle took place at Merta, where the Rathors were defeated
and dispersed; but in revenge Sangram burned the suburbs of
Jodhpur, and then came to Dunara, where once more the clans
assembled. They marched, invested Jalor, when Bihari, left
without succour, was compelled to capitulate, and the gate of
honour (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>dharmadwara</em></span>) was left open to him. And thus ended

<div class='footnote' id='f5.7.15'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r5.7.15'>15</a>. It may be well to exhibit the manner in which the poetic annalist of
Rajputana narrates such events, and to give them in his own language
rather than in an epitome, by which not only the pith of the original would
be lost, but the events themselves deprived of half their interest. The
character of historic fidelity will thus be preserved from suspicion, which
could scarcely be withheld if the narrative were exhibited in any but its
native garb. This will also serve to sustain the Annals of Marwar, formed
from a combination of such materials, and dispose the reader to acknowledge
the impossibility of reducing such animated chronicles to the severe style
of history. But more than all, it is with the design to prove what, in the
preface of this work, the reader was compelled to take on credit; that the
Rajput kingdoms were in no ages without such chronicles: and if we may
not compare them with Froissart, or with Monstrelet, they may be allowed
to compete with the Anglo-Saxon chronicles, and they certainly surpass
those of Ulster. But we have stronger motives than even legitimate
curiosity, in allowing the bard to tell his own tale of the thirty years’ war
of Rajputana; the desire which has animated this task from its commencement,
to give a correct idea of the importance of these events, and to hold
them up as a beacon to the present governors of these brave men. How
well that elegant historian, Orme, appreciates their importance, as bearing
on our own conduct in power, the reader will perceive by reference to his
<cite>Fragments</cite> [ed. 1782, note i.], where he says, “There are no states or powers
on the continent of India, with whom our nation has either connexion or
concern, which do not owe the origin of their present condition to the reign
of Aurangzebe, or to its influence on the reigns of his successors.” It
behoves us, therefore, to make ourselves acquainted with the causes as well
as the characters of those who occasioned the downfall of our predecessors
in the sovereignty of India. With this object in view, the bard shall tell
his own tale from the birth of Ajit, in S. 1737, to 1767, when he had vanquished
all opposition to Aurangzeb, and regained the throne of Maru.</p>

professional, deny its being contagious. At Udaipur, the Rana’s only son,
hermetically sealed in the palace against contact, was the first seized with
the disorder; a pretty strong proof that it was from atmospheric communication.
He was also the last man in his father’s dominions likely, from
predisposition, to be attacked, being one of the most athletic and prudent
of his subjects. I saw him through the disorder. We were afraid to
administer remedies to the last heir of Bappa Rawal, but I hinted to Amarji,

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Ajīt Singh produced to the Rāthors, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1686.</h4>—“In the year
1743, the Champawats, Kumpawats, Udawats, Mertias, Jodhas,
Karamsots, and all the assembled clans of Maru, became impatient
to see their sovereign. They sent for the Khichi Mukund, and
prayed that they might but [73] behold him; but the faithful
to his trust replied: ‘He,<a id='r5.8.1' /><a href='#f5.8.1' class='c013'><sup>[1]</sup></a> who confided him to me, is yet in the
Deccan.’—‘Without the sight of our Lord, bread and water
have no flavour.’ Mukund could not withstand their suit.
The Hara prince Durjan Sal, having come to their aid with one
thousand horse from Kotah,<a id='r5.8.2' /><a href='#f5.8.2' class='c013'><sup>[2]</sup></a> they repaired to the hill of Abu,
when on the last day of Chait 1743 they saw their prince. As
the lotus expands at the sunbeam, so did the heart of each Rathor
at the sight of their infant sovereign; they drank his looks,
even as the papiha in the month Asoj sips drops of amrita
(ambrosia) from the Champa.<a id='r5.8.3' /><a href='#f5.8.3' class='c013'><sup>[3]</sup></a> There were present, Udai Singh,
Sangram Singh, Bijaipal, Tej Singh, Mukund Singh, and Nahar
son of Hari, all Champawats; Raj Singh, Jagat Singh, Jeth
Singh, Samant Singh, of the Udawats; Ram Singh, Fateh Singh,
and Kesari, Kumpawats. There was also the Uhar chief of pure
descent,<a id='r5.8.4' /><a href='#f5.8.4' class='c013'><sup>[4]</sup></a> besides the Khichi Mukund, the Purohit, the Parihar,
and the Jain priest, Yati Gyan, Bijai. In a fortunate hour, Ajit
became known to the world. The Hara Rao first made his salutation;
he was followed by all Marwar with offerings of gold,
pearls, and horses.</div>

<p class='c001'>“Inayat conveyed the tidings to Aurang Shah; the Asur
chief said to the king, ‘If without a head so long they had combated
him, what could now be expected?’ He demanded
reinforcements.</p>

<div class='section-start'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1008'>1008</span><h4 class='disp-inline'>Ajīt Singh installed.</h4>—“In triumph they conveyed the young
Raja to Awa, whose chief made the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>badhava</em></span><a id='r5.8.5' /><a href='#f5.8.5' class='c013'><sup>[5]</sup></a> with pearls, and
presented him with horses; here he was entertained, and here
they prepared the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>tika daur</em></span>.<a id='r5.8.6' /><a href='#f5.8.6' class='c013'><sup>[6]</sup></a> Thence, taking Raepur, Bilara,
and Barunda in his way, and receiving the homage and nazars
of their chiefs, he repaired to Asop, where he was entertained by
the head of the Kumpawats. From Asop he went to the Bhatti
fief of Lawera; thence to Rian, the chief abode of the Mertias;
thence to Khinwasar, of the Karamsots. Each chief entertained
their young lord, around whom all the clans gathered. Then he
repaired to Kalu, the abode of Pabhu Rao Dhandal,<a id='r5.8.7' /><a href='#f5.8.7' class='c013'><sup>[7]</sup></a> who came
forth with all his bands; and at length [74] he reached Pokaran,
where he was joined by Durgadas from the Deccan, the 10th of
Bhadon 1744.</div>

<p class='c001'>“Inayat Khan was alarmed. He assembled a numerous array
to quell this fresh tumult, but death pounced upon him. The
king was afflicted thereat. He tried another stratagem, and
set up a pretended son of Jaswant, styled Muhammad Shah, and
offered Ajit the mansab of five thousand to submit to his
authority.<a id='r5.8.8' /><a href='#f5.8.8' class='c013'><sup>[8]</sup></a> The pretender also died as he set out for Jodhpur,
and Shujaat Khan<a id='r5.8.9' /><a href='#f5.8.9' class='c013'><sup>[9]</sup></a> was made the governor of Marwar in place of
Inayat. Now the Rathors and Haras united, having cleared
Maru of their foes, attacked them in a foreign land. The garrisons
of Malpura and Pur Mandal were put to the sword, and here the
Hara prince was killed by a cannon shot in leading the storm.
Here they levied eight thousand mohurs in contribution and
returned to Marwar, while the civil officers and Purohits made
collections in his country; and thus passed 1744.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The year 1745 commenced with proposals from Shujaat
Khan to hold Marwar in farm; he promised one-fourth of all
transit duties if the Rathors would respect foreign commerce:
to this they agreed. The son of Inayat left Jodhpur for Delhi;
he had reached Renwal, but was overtaken by the Jodha Harnath,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1009'>1009</span>who released him both of wives and wealth. The Khan fled to
the Kachhwahas for shelter. Suja Beg, who left Ajmer to release
him, fared no better: he was attacked, defeated, and plundered
by Mukunddas Champawat.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>War with the Mughals.</h4>—“In 1747, Safi Khan was Hakim of
Ajmer: Durga determined to attack him. The Hakim took
post in the pass which defends the road; there Durga assailed
him, and made him fly to Ajmer. The tidings reached the king;
he wrote to the Khan, if he discomfited Durgadas, he would raise
him over all the Khans of the empire; if he failed, he should
send him bracelets,<a id='r5.8.10' /><a href='#f5.8.10' class='c013'><sup>[10]</sup></a> and order Shujaat from Jodhpur to supersede
him. Safi, before abandoning his trust, tried to retain
his honours by the circumvention of Ajit. He addressed a letter
to him, saying he held the imperial sanad for the restoration
of his paternal domains, but that, as the king’s representative, he
must come and receive it. Ajit marched at the head of twenty
thousand Rathors, sending in advance Mukund Champawat to
observe whether any treachery was contemplated. The snare
was discovered and reported to Ajit, as he arrived at the foot of
the pass beyond the mountains. ‘Let us, however, have [75] a
sight of Ajaidurg as we are so near,’ said the young prince, ‘and
receive the compliments of the Khan.’ They moved on towards
the city, and Safi Khan had no alternative but to pay his obeisance
to Ajit. To enjoy his distress, one said, ‘Let us fire the
city.’ The Hakim sat trembling for its safety and his own; he
brought forth jewels and horses which he presented to Ajit.</div>

<p class='c001'>“In 1748, the troubles recommenced in Mewar. Prince Amra
rebelled against his father, Rana Jai Singh, and was joined by
all his chiefs. The Rana fled to Godwar, and at Ghanerao
collected a force, which Amra prepared to attack. The Rana
demanded succour of the Rathors, and all the Mertias hastened
to relieve him; and soon after Ajit sent Durgadas and Bhagwan,
with Ranmall Jodha, and ‘the eight ranks of Rathors,’ to espouse
the father’s cause. But the Chondawats and Saktawats, the
Jhalas and Chauhans, rather than admit foreign interference in
their quarrel, thought it better to effect a reconciliation between
father and son; and thus the Rana was indebted to Marwar for
the support of his throne.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Aurangzeb negotiates about Akbar’s Daughter.</h4>—“The year
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1010'>1010</span>1749 passed in negotiation to obtain the daughter of prince Akbar,
left in charge of Durgadas, for whose honour Aurangzeb was
alarmed, as Ajit was reaching manhood; Narayandas Kulumbi
was the medium of negotiation, and Safi Khan caused all hostilities
to cease while it lasted.</div>

<p class='c001'>“In 1750, the Muslim governors of Jodhpur, Jalor, and Siwana
combined their forces against Ajit, who was again compelled to
retreat to the mountains. Akha, the Bala, received their attack,
but was defeated in the month of Magh. Another combat was
hastened by the wanton slaughter of a <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>sand</em></span>,<a id='r5.8.11' /><a href='#f5.8.11' class='c013'><sup>[11]</sup></a> when the Hakim of
Chank, with all his train, were made prisoners at Mokalsar by
the Champawat Mukanddas.</p>

<p class='c001'>“To such straits were the Muslims put in 1751, that many
districts paid chauth, others tribute, and many, tired of this incessant
warfare, and unable to conquer their bread, took service
with the Rathors. This year, Kasim Khan and Lashkar Khan
marched against Ajit, who took post at Bijaipur. Durga’s son
led the onset, and the Khan was defeated. With each year of
Ajit grew the hopes of the Rathors; while Aurangzeb was afflicted
at each month’s growth of his granddaughter. He wrote to
Shujaat, the Hakim of Jodhpur, to secure his honour at whatever
cost; his applications for Akbar’s daughter were unwearied [76].</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Ajīt Singh marries a Princess of Mewar.</h4>—“This year the coco-nut
studded with gems,<a id='r5.8.12' /><a href='#f5.8.12' class='c013'><sup>[12]</sup></a> two elephants and ten steeds, all richly
caparisoned, were sent by the Rana to affiance the daughter of
his younger brother, Gaj Singh, to Ajit. The present was accepted,
and in the month of Jeth, the prince of the Rathors repaired to
Udaipur, where the nuptials were solemnized. In Asarh he again
married at Deolia.<a id='r5.8.13' /><a href='#f5.8.13' class='c013'><sup>[13]</sup></a></div>

<p class='c001'>“In 1753, negotiations were renewed through Durgadas, and
the protracted restoration of the Sultani obtained the seat of his
ancestors for the Jodhani. Durga was offered for himself the
mansab of five thousand, which he refused; he preferred that
Jalor, Siwanchi, Sanchor, and Tharad<a id='r5.8.14' /><a href='#f5.8.14' class='c013'><sup>[14]</sup></a> should revert to his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1011'>1011</span>country. Even Aurang admired the honourable and distinguished
treatment of his granddaughter.</p>

<p class='c001'>“In Pus 1757,<a id='r5.8.15' /><a href='#f5.8.15' class='c013'><sup>[15]</sup></a> Ajit regained possession of his ancestral abode:
on his reaching Jodhpur he slew a buffalo at each of its five gates.<a id='r5.8.16' /><a href='#f5.8.16' class='c013'><sup>[16]</sup></a>
The Shahzada Sultan led the way, Shujaat being dead.<a id='r5.8.17' /><a href='#f5.8.17' class='c013'><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>“In 1759, Azam Shah again seized on Jodhpur, and Ajit
made Jalor his abode. Some of his chiefs now served the foe,
some the Rana whose hopes were on Eklinga alone; while the
lord of Amber served the king in the Deccan. The enormities
of the Asurs had reached their height; the sacred kine were
sacrificed even at Mathura, Prayag, and Okhamandal; the
Jogis and Bairagis invoked heaven for protection, but iniquity
prevailed as the Hindu strength decayed. Prayers were everywhere
offered up to heaven to cleanse the land from the iniquities
of the barbarians.<a id='r5.8.18' /><a href='#f5.8.18' class='c013'><sup>[18]</sup></a> In this year, the month of Magh 1759, the
Mithun Lagan (the ‘sun in Gemini’), a son was born of the
Chauhani, who was called Abhai Singh. (See end of this chapter,
p. <a href='#i1019'>1019</a>, for the Horoscope of Abhai Singh.)</p>

<p class='c001'>“In 1761, Yusuf was superseded by Murshid Kuli as Hakim
of Jodhpur. On his arrival he presented the royal sanad for
the restoration of Merta to Ajit. Kusal Singh, the Mertia Sarmor,
with the Dhandhal Govinddas, were ordered to [77] take the
charge, which incensed the son of Indar (Mohkam Singh), who
deemed his faithful service during his minority overlooked by
this preference. He wrote to the king to nominate him to the
command of Marwar, and that he would fulfil his charge to the
satisfaction both of Hindu and Muslim.</p>

<p class='c001'>“In 1761 the star of the foe began to decline. Murshid Kuli,
the Mogul, was relieved by Jaafar Khan. Mohkam’s letter was
intercepted. He had turned traitor to his prince, and joined
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1012'>1012</span>the king’s troops. Ajit marched against them; he fought them
at Dunara; the king’s troops were defeated, and the rebel
Indhawat was slain. This was in 1762.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Death of Aurangzeb, March 3, 1707.</h4>—“In 1763, Ibrahim Khan,
the king’s lieutenant<a id='r5.8.19' /><a href='#f5.8.19' class='c013'><sup>[19]</sup></a> at Lahore, passed through Marwar to
relieve Azam in the vice-royalty of Gujarat. On the second day
of Chait, the obscure half of the moon, the joyful tidings arrived
of the death of the king.<a id='r5.8.20' /><a href='#f5.8.20' class='c013'><sup>[20]</sup></a> On the fifth, Ajit took to horse; he
reached the town of Jodha, and sacrificed to the gates, but the
Asurs feared to face him. Some hid their faces in fear, while
others fled. The Mirza came down, and Ajit ascended to the
halls of his ancestors. The wretched Yavans, now abandoned
to the infuriated Rajputs smarting under twenty-six years of
misery, found no mercy. In hopeless despair they fled, and the
wealth which they had amassed by extortion and oppression
returned to enrich the proprietor. The barbarians, in turn, were
made captive; they fought, were slaughtered and dispersed.
Some sought <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>saran</em></span> (sanctuary), and found it; even the barbarian
leader himself threw fear to the winds in the unconcealed sanctuary
of the Kumpawat. But the triumph of the Hindu was complete,
when, to escape from perdition, their flying foes invoked Sitaram
and Hargovind, begging their bread in the day, and taking to
their heels at night. The chaplet of the Mulla served to count
the name of Rama, and a handful of gold was given to have their
beards removed.<a id='r5.8.21' /><a href='#f5.8.21' class='c013'><sup>[21]</sup></a> Nothing but the despair and flight of the
Mlechchha was heard throughout Murdhar. Merta was evacuated,
and the wounded Mohkam fled to Nagor. Sojat and Pali were
regained, and the land returned to the Jodhani. Jodhgarh was
purified from the contaminations of the barbarian with the water
of the Ganges and the sacred Tulasi, and Ajit received the tilak
of sovereignty.</div>

<p class='c001'>“Then Azam marched from the south and Muazzam from the
north. At Agra a [78] mighty battle for empire took place
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1013'>1013</span>between the two Asurs, but Alam<a id='r5.8.22' /><a href='#f5.8.22' class='c013'><sup>[22]</sup></a> prevailed and got the throne.
The tidings soon reached the king, that Ajit had plundered his
armies in Maru and taken possession of the ‘cushion’ of his
fathers.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Campaign of Bahādur Shāh.</h4>—“The rainy season of 1764 had
vanished, the king had no repose; he formed an army and came
to Ajmer. Then Haridas, the son of Bhagwan, with the Uhar
and Mangalia chiefs,<a id='r5.8.23' /><a href='#f5.8.23' class='c013'><sup>[23]</sup></a> and Ratna the leader of the Udawats,
with eight hundred of their clan, entered the castle and swore to
Ajit, that whatever might be his intentions, they were resolved
to maintain the castle to the death. The royal army encamped
at Bhavi Bilara, and Ajit prepared for the storm; but the king
was advised to try peaceful arts, and an overture was made, and
the messenger was sent back to the king accompanied by Nahar
Khan. The embassy returned bearing the royal farman to Ajit;
but before he would accept it, he said he would view the royal
army, and on the first day of Phalgun he left the hill of Jodha
and reached Bisalpur. Here he was received by a deputation
from the king, headed by Shujaat Khan, son of the Khankhanan
accompanied by the Raja of the Bhadaurias and Rao Budh Singh
of Bundi—the place of meeting was Pipar. That night passed
in adjusting the terms of the treaty.<a id='r5.8.24' /><a href='#f5.8.24' class='c013'><sup>[24]</sup></a> The ensuing morn he
marched forward at the head of all the men of Maru; and at
Anandpur the eyes of the king of the barbarians (Mlechchha)
fell on those of the lord of the earth. He gave him the title of
Tegh Bahadur.<a id='r5.8.25' /><a href='#f5.8.25' class='c013'><sup>[25]</sup></a> But fate decreed that the city of Jodha was
coveted by the king; by stealth he sent Mahrab Khan to take
possession, accompanied by the traitor Mohkam. Ajit burned
with rage when he heard of this treachery, but he was compelled
to dissimulate and accompany Alam to the Deccan, and to serve
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1014'>1014</span>under Kambakhsh. Jai Singh of Amber<a id='r5.8.26' /><a href='#f5.8.26' class='c013'><sup>[26]</sup></a> was also with the
king, and had a like cause for discontent, a royal garrison being
placed in Amber, and the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>gaddi</em></span> of the Raja bestowed on his
younger brother, Bijai Singh. Now the army rolled on like a
sea overflowing its bounds. As soon as the king crossed the
Nerbudda,<a id='r5.8.27' /><a href='#f5.8.27' class='c013'><sup>[27]</sup></a> the Rajas executed their designs, and, without saying
a word, at the head of their vassals retrograded to Rajwara.
They repaired to Udaipur, and were received by Rana Amra
with rejoicing and distinction [79], who advanced to conduct
them to his capital. Seated together, the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>chaunri</em></span> waving over
their heads, they appeared like the Trianga,<a id='r5.8.28' /><a href='#f5.8.28' class='c013'><sup>[28]</sup></a> Brahma, Vishnu
and Mahesa. From this hour the fortunes of the Asurs sunk,
and virtue again began to show herself.<a id='r5.8.29' /><a href='#f5.8.29' class='c013'><sup>[29]</sup></a> From Udaipur the
two Rajas passed to Marwar. They reached Awa, and here the
Champawat Sangram, son of Udaibhan, spread the foot-carpet
(<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>pagmanda</em></span>) for his lord.</div>

<p class='c001'>“The month of Sawan 1765 set in, and the hopes of the Asur
expired. Mahrab was in consternation when he heard that Ajit
had returned to his native land. On the 7th the hall of Jodha
was surrounded by thirty thousand Rathors. On the 12th the
gate of honour was thrown open to Mahrab; he had to thank
the son of Askaran<a id='r5.8.30' /><a href='#f5.8.30' class='c013'><sup>[30]</sup></a> for his life. He was allowed an honourable
retreat, and Ajit once more entered the capital of Maru.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Jai Singh encamped upon the banks of the Sur Sagar; but
a prince without a country, he was unhappy. But as soon as
the rains were passed, Ajmall, the sanctuary of the Kachhwaha,
proposed to reinstate him in Amber. When conjoined they had
reached Merta, Agra and Delhi trembled. When they arrived
at Ajmer its governor sought <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>saran</em></span> with the saint,<a id='r5.8.31' /><a href='#f5.8.31' class='c013'><sup>[31]</sup></a> and paid the
contributions demanded. Then, like the falcon, Ajit darted upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1015'>1015</span>Sambhar; and here the vassals of Amber repaired from all
quarters to the standard of their lord. With twelve thousand
men, the Sayyid advanced along the edge of the salt lake, to
encounter Ajmall. The Kumpawat led the charge; a desperate
battle ensued; Husain, with six thousand men, lay on the field,
while the rest took to flight and sought refuge in the castle.<a id='r5.8.32' /><a href='#f5.8.32' class='c013'><sup>[32]</sup></a>
His lieutenant, the Parihar, chief Pandu,<a id='r5.8.33' /><a href='#f5.8.33' class='c013'><sup>[33]</sup></a> here fell into the hands
of Ajit; he then felt he had recovered Mandor. On intelligence
of this history, the Asurs abandoned Amber, and having placed
a garrison in Sambhar, in the month of Margsir, Ajit restored
Jai Singh to Amber, and prepared to attack Bikaner. Ajit
committed the administration of all civil affairs to the faithful
Raghunath Bhandari, with the [80] title of Diwan. He was well
qualified, both from his experience in civil affairs and from his
valour as a soldier.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Death of Prince Kāmbakhsh.</h4>—“In Bhadon of the year 1766,
Aurangzeb put to death Kambakhsh,<a id='r5.8.34' /><a href='#f5.8.34' class='c013'><sup>[34]</sup></a> and Jai Singh entered
into negotiations with the king. Ajit now went against Nagor;
but Indar Singh being without resource, came forth and embraced
Ajit’s feet, who bestowed Ladnun upon him as a heritage. But
this satisfied not him who had been the lord of Nagor, and Indar
carried his complaints to Delhi.<a id='r5.8.35' /><a href='#f5.8.35' class='c013'><sup>[35]</sup></a> The king was enraged—his
threats reached the Rajas, who deemed it safe again to reunite.
They met at Kolia near Didwana, and the king soon after reached
Ajmer. Thence he sent his firmans and the panja as terms of
friendship to the Rajas: Nahar Khan, Chela of the king, was
the bearer. They were accepted, and on the 1st Asarh both
the Rajas repaired to Ajmer. Here the king received them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1016'>1016</span>graciously, in the face of the world; to Ajit he presented the
sanad of the Nine Castles of Maru, and to Jai Singh that of Amber.

<div class='section-start'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1017'>1017</span><h4 class='disp-inline'>Eulogy of Durgadās.</h4>—Here let us, for a while, suspend the
narrative of the chronicler, and take a retrospective glance at
the transactions of the Rathors, from the year 1737 [<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1680],
the period of Raja Jaswant’s death at Kabul, to the restoration
of Ajit, presenting a continuous conflict of thirty years’ duration.
In vain might we search the annals of any other nation for such
inflexible devotion as marked the Rathor character through this
period of strife, during which, to use their own phrase, “hardly
a chieftain died on his pallet.” Let those who deem the Hindu
warrior void of patriotism read the rude chronicle of this thirty
years’ war; let them compare it with that of any other country,
and do justice to the magnanimous Rajput. This narrative, the
simplicity of which is the best voucher for its authenticity, presents
an uninterrupted record of patriotism and disinterested loyalty.
It was a period when the sacrifice of these principles was rewarded
by the tyrant king with the highest honours of the state; nor are
we without instances of the temptation being too strong to be
withstood; but they are rare, and serve only to exhibit, in more
pleasing colours, the virtues of the tribe which spurned the
attempts at seduction. What a splendid example is the heroic
Durgadas of all that constitutes the glory of the Rajput! Valour,
loyalty, integrity, combined with prudence in all the difficulties
which surrounded him, are qualities which entitle him to the
admiration which his memory continues to enjoy. The temptations
held out to him were almost irresistible: not merely the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1018'>1018</span>gold, which he and thousands of his brethren would alike have
spurned, but the splendid offer of power in the proffered mansab
of five thousand, which would at once have lifted him from his
vassal condition to an equality with the [82] princes and chief
nobles of the land. Durga had, indeed, but to name his reward;
but, as the bard justly says, he was <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>amol</em></span>, beyond all price, <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>anokha</em></span>,
unique. Not even revenge, so dear to the Rajput, turned him
aside from the dictates of true honour. The foul assassination
of his brother, the brave Soning, effected through his enemies,
made no alteration in his humanity whenever the chance of war
placed his foe in his power; and in this, his policy seconded his
virtue. His chivalrous conduct, in the extrication of prince
Akbar from inevitable destruction had he fallen into his father’s
hands, was only surpassed by his generous and delicate behaviour
towards the prince’s family, which was left in his care, forming a
marked contrast to that of the enemies of his faith on similar
occasions. The virtue of the granddaughter of Aurangzeb, in
the sanctuary (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>saran</em></span>) of Dunara,<a id='r5.8.39' /><a href='#f5.8.39' class='c013'><sup>[39]</sup></a> was in far better keeping than
in the trebly-walled harem of Agra. Of his energetic mind, and
the control he exerted over those of his confiding brethren, what
a proof is given, in his preserving the secret of the abode of his
prince throughout the six first years of his infancy! But, to
conclude our eulogy in the words of their bard: he has reaped
the immortality destined for good deeds; his memory is cherished,
his actions are the theme of constant praise, and his picture on
his white horse, old, yet in vigour, is familiar amongst the collections
of portraits of Rajputana.<a id='r5.8.40' /><a href='#f5.8.40' class='c013'><sup>[40]</sup></a></div>

<p class='c001'>But there was not a clan, or family, that did not produce men
of worth in this protracted warfare, which incited constant emulation;
and the bards of each had abundant materials to emblazon
the pages of their chronicles. To the recollection of these, their
expatriated descendants allude in the memorial<a id='r5.8.41' /><a href='#f5.8.41' class='c013'><sup>[41]</sup></a> of their hardships
from the cruel policy of the reigning chief, the last lineal
descendant of the prince, whose history has just been narrated.
We now resume the narrative in the language of the chronicle [83].</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>In the Janampatri, or horoscope of Abhai Singh (referred to in
p. 1011), the 4th, 7th, 8th, 10th, 11th, and 12th houses denote the
destinies of the heir of Ajit. In the 4th we have the monster Rahu,
the author of eclipses. Of the 7th, or house of heirs, the Moon and
Venus have taken possession; of the 8th, or house of strife, the Sun
and Mercury. In the 10th is Ketu, brother of Rahu, both signs of
evil portent. Mars rides in the house of fate, while Saturn and Jupiter
are together in the abode of sovereignty. Like that of every man
living, the horoscope of the heir of Maru is filled with good and evil:
could the Jotishi or astrological seer have put the parricidal sign in the
house of destiny, he might have claimed some merit for superior
intelligence. Those who have ever consulted any works on this foolish
pursuit will observe that the diagrams of the European astrologers
are exact copies of the Hindu, in proof of which I have inserted this;
to trace darkness as well as light from the East!</p>

Marwar, lost his birthright, and was afterwards slain at court, as already
related. His son, Indar Singh and grandson Mohkam, from Nagor, which
they held in separate grants from the king, never forgot their title as elder
branch of the family, and eternally contested their claim against Ajit.
Still, as a Rathor, he was bound to avenge the injuries of a Rathor, even
though his personal foe.—Singular inconsistency!</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f5.8.38'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r5.8.38'>38</a>. There is an anecdote regarding the fountain of this classic field of strife,
the Troad of Rajasthan, which well exemplifies the superstitious belief of
the warlike Rajput. The emperor Bahadur Shah was desirous to visit this
scene of the exploits of the heroes of antiquity, stimulated, no doubt, by
his Rajputni queen, or his mother, also of this race. He was seated under
a tree which shaded the sacred fount, named after the great leader of the
Kauravas, his queen by his side, surrounded by <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>kanats</em></span> to hide them from
profane eyes, when a vulture perched upon the tree with a bone in its beak,
which falling in the fountain, the bird set up a scream of laughter. The
king looked up in astonishment, which was greatly increased when the
vulture addressed him in human accents, saying “that in a former birth
she was a Jogini, and was in the field of slaughter of the Great War, whence
she flew away with the dissevered arm of one of its mighty warriors, with
which she alighted on that very tree, that the arm was encumbered with a
ponderous golden bracelet, in which, as an amulet, were set thirteen brilliant
symbols of Siva, and that after devouring the flesh, she dropped the bracelet,
which fell into the fountain, and it was this awakened coincidence which had
caused the scream of laughter.” We must suppose that this, the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>palada</em></span>
of the field of slaughter, spoke Sanskrit or its dialect, interpreted by his
Rajput queen. Instantly the pioneers were commanded to clear the
fountain, and behold the relic of the Mahabharata, with the symbolic
emblems of the god all-perfect! and so large were they, that the emperor
remarked they would answer excellently well for “slaves of the carpet.”<a id='r5.8.38.A' /><a href='#f5.8.38.A' class='c013'><sup>[A]</sup></a>
The Hindu princes then present, among whom were the Rajas Ajit and Jai
Singh, were shocked at this levity, and each entreated of the king one of
the phallic symbols. The Mirza Raja obtained two, and both are yet at
Jaipur, one in the Temple of Silah Devi,<a id='r5.8.38.B' /><a href='#f5.8.38.B' class='c013'><sup>[B]</sup></a> the other in that of Govinda.
Ajit had one, still preserved and worshipped at the shrine of Girdhari at
Jodhpur. My old tutor and friend, the Yati Gyanchandra, who told the
story while he read the chronicles as I translated them, has often seen and
made homage to all the three relics. There is one, he believed, at Bundi
or Kotah, and the Rana by some means obtained another. They are of pure
rock crystal, and as each weighs some pounds, there must have been giants
in the days of the Bharat, to have supported thirteen in one armlet.
Homer’s heroes were pigmies to the Kauravas, whose bracelet we may doubt
if Ajax could have lifted. My venerable tutor, though liberal in his opinions,
did not choose to dissent from the general belief, for man, he said, had
beyond a doubt greatly degenerated since the heroic ages, and was rapidly
approximating to the period, the immediate forerunner of a universal
renovation, when only dwarfs would creep over the land.</p>

we must interrupt the narrative, in order to supply an
important omission of the bard, who slurs over the hardest of
the conditions demanded of Ajit on the invasion of the Sayyid,
namely, the giving a daughter to Farrukhsiyar, the important
political results of which are already related in the first part of
this work.<a id='r5.9.13' /><a href='#f5.9.13' class='c013'><sup>[13]</sup></a> This compulsory marriage only aggravated Ajit’s
desire of vengeance, and he entered into the views of the Sayyids
with the true spirit of his father; obtaining meanwhile, as the
price of coalition, the compliance with the specified demands,
besides others of less moment, such as “that the bell for prayer
should be allowed to toll in the [86] quarters of the city allotted
to the Rajputs, and that their temples should be held sacred;
and last, but not least, the aggrandisement of his hereditary
dominions.” Let us again recur to the chronicle.</div>

<p class='c001'>“In Jeth 1771, having secured all his wishes, Ajit left the court,
and with the renewed patent as viceroy of Gujarat, returned to

prepared to visit this government: Abhai Singh accompanied
his father. He first proceeded to Jalor, where he passed the
rainy season. Thence he attacked the Mewasa:<a id='r5.9.14' /><a href='#f5.9.14' class='c013'><sup>[14]</sup></a> first Nimaj,
which he took, when the Deoras paid him tribute. Firoz Khan
advanced from Palanpur to meet him. The Rao of Tharad
paid a lakh of rupees. Cambay was invested and paid; and the
Koli chief, Kemkaran, was reduced. From Patan, Sakta the
Champawat, with Bija Bhandari, sent the year preceding to
manage the province, came forth to meet him.</div>

<p class='c001'>“In 1773, Ajit reduced the Jhala of Halwad, and Jam of
Nawanagar, who paid as tribute three lacs of rupees, with twenty-five

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Ajīt Singh visits Delhi.</h4>—“The year 1774 had now arrived.
The Sayyids and their opponents were engaged in civil strife.
Husain Ali was in the Deccan, and the mind of Abdulla was
alienated from the king. Paper on paper came, inviting Ajit.
He marched by Nagor, Merta, Pushkar, Marot, and Sambhar,
whose garrisons he strengthened, to Delhi. From Marot he sent
Abhai Singh back to take care of Jodhpur. The Sayyid advanced
from Delhi to meet the Dhani (lord) of Marwar, who alighted at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1023'>1023</span>Allahwirdi’s sarai. Here the Sayyid and Ajit formed a league
to oppose Jai Singh and the Moguls, while the king remained
like a snake coiled up in a closed vessel. To get rid of their
chief opponent, Zu-l-faqar Khan, was first determined [87].</div>

<p class='c001'>“When the king heard that Ajit had reached Delhi, he sent
the Hara Rao Bhim of Kotah, and Khandauran Khan to introduce
him to the presence. Ajit obeyed. Besides his own Rathors,
he was accompanied by Rao Bishan Singh of Jaisalmer, and
Padam Singh of Derawar, with Fateh Singh, a noble of Mewar,
Man Singh, Rathor, chief of Sita Mhau, and the Chandarawat,
Gopal of Rampura, besides Udai Singh of Kandela, Sakat Singh
of Manoharpur, Kishan of Kalchipur, and many others.<a id='r5.9.17' /><a href='#f5.9.17' class='c013'><sup>[17]</sup></a> The
meeting took place at the Moti Bagh. The king bestowed the
mansab of Haft Hazari (seven thousand horse) on Ajit, and
added a crore of dams to his rent-roll. He presented him with
the insignia of the Mahi Muratib,<a id='r5.9.18' /><a href='#f5.9.18' class='c013'><sup>[18]</sup></a> with elephants and horses,
a sword and dagger, a diamond aigrette (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>sarpech</em></span>) and plume,
and a double string of pearls. Having left the presence, Ajit
went to visit Abdulla Khan. The Sayyid advanced to meet him,
and his reception, with his attendants, was distinguished. They
renewed their determination to stand or fall together. Their
conference caused dismay to the Moguls, who lay in ambush to
put Ajit to death.</p>

<p class='c001'>“On the second day of the bright moon of Pus, 1775 [<span class='fss'>A.D.</span>
1718], the king honoured Ajit with a visit. Ajit seated the king
on a throne formed of bags of rupees to the amount of one lakh,<a id='r5.9.19' /><a href='#f5.9.19' class='c013'><sup>[19]</sup></a>
and presented elephants, horses, and all that was precious. In
the month of Phalgun, Ajit and the Sayyid went to visit the
king; and after the conference wrote to Husain Ali revealing
their plans, and desiring his rapid march to unite with them
from the Deccan. Now the heavens assumed portentous appearances;
the Disasul<a id='r5.9.20' /><a href='#f5.9.20' class='c013'><sup>[20]</sup></a> was red and fiery; jackasses brayed unusually;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1024'>1024</span>dogs barked; thunder rolled without a cloud; the
court, late so gay, was now sad and gloomy; all were forebodings
of change at Delhi. In twenty days, Husain reached Delhi;
his countenance was terrific; his drum, which now beat close
to the palace, was the knell of falling greatness. He was accompanied
by myriads of horse. Delhi was enveloped in the dust
raised by his hostile steeds. They encamped in the north of
the city, and Husain joined Ajit and his brother. The trembling
king sent congratulations and gifts; the Mogul chiefs kept aloof
in their abodes; even as the quail cowers in the grass when the
falcon hovers over it, so did the Moguls when Husain reached
Delhi.<a id='r5.9.21' /><a href='#f5.9.21' class='c013'><sup>[21]</sup></a> The lord of Amber was like a lamp left without oil [88].</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Revolution at Delhi.</h4>—“On the second day, all convened
at Ajit’s tents, on the banks of the Jumna, to execute the plans
now determined upon. Ajit mounted his steed; at the head of
his Rathors he marched direct to the palace, and at every post
he placed his own men: he looked like the fire destined to cause
<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>pralaya</em></span>.<a id='r5.9.22' /><a href='#f5.9.22' class='c013'><sup>[22]</sup></a> When the sun appears darkness flies; when the oil
fails the lamp goes out: so is it with crowns and kings, when
good faith and justice, the oil that feeds their power, is wanting.
The crash which shivered the umbrella of Delhi reverberated
throughout the land. The royal treasures were plundered.
None amidst the Moguls came forward to rescue their king
(Farrukhsiyar), and Jai Singh fled from the scene of destruction.
Another king was set up, but in four months he was seized with
a distemper and died. Then Daula<a id='r5.9.23' /><a href='#f5.9.23' class='c013'><sup>[23]</sup></a> was placed on the throne.
But the Moguls at Delhi set up Neko Shah<a id='r5.9.24' /><a href='#f5.9.24' class='c013'><sup>[24]</sup></a> at Agra, and Husain
marched against them, leaving Ajit and Abdulla with the king.<a id='r5.9.25' /><a href='#f5.9.25' class='c013'><sup>[25]</sup></a></div>

and the Sayyid moved from Delhi; but the Moguls surrendered
Neko Shah, who was confined in Salimgarh. At this time the
king died, and Ajit and the Sayyids made another, and placed
Muhammad Shah on the throne. Many countries were destroyed,
and many were made to flourish, during the dethronement of
kings by Ajit. With the death of Farrukhsiyar Jai Singh’s views
were crushed, and the Sayyids determined to punish him. The
lord of Amber was like water carried in a platter.<a id='r5.9.26' /><a href='#f5.9.26' class='c013'><sup>[26]</sup></a> The king
reached the Dargah at Sikri, in progress to Amber, and here the
chieftains sought the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>saran</em></span> (sanctuary) of Ajit. They said the
Kurma<a id='r5.9.27' /><a href='#f5.9.27' class='c013'><sup>[27]</sup></a> was lost if he protected them not against the Sayyids.
Even as Krishna saved Arjun in the Bharat, so did Ajit take
Jai Singh under his protection. He sent the chiefs of the Champawats
and his minister to dispel his fears; they returned with
the lord of Amber, who felt like one who had escaped the doom
(<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>pralaya</em></span>). Ajit placed one monarch on the throne, and saved
another from destruction. The king bestowed upon him the
grant of Ahmadabad, and gave him permission to visit his home.
With Jai Singh of Amber, and Budh Singh Hara of Bundi, he
marched for Jodhpur, and in the way contracted a marriage
with the daughter of the Shaikhavat [89] chief of Manoharpur.
In the month of Asin he reached Jodhagir, when the lord of
Amber encamped at Sur Sagar, and the Hara Rao north of the
town.</div>

He slew the king’s governor and seized on Taragarh.<a id='r5.9.29' /><a href='#f5.9.29' class='c013'><sup>[29]</sup></a> Once

Mosque. The Kazi made way for the Brahman, and the pit of
burnt sacrifice (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>homa</em></span>) was dug, where the sacred kine were slain.
He took possession of the salt lakes of Sambhar and Didwana,
and the records were always moist with inserting fresh conquests.
Ajit ascended his own throne; the umbrella of supremacy he
waved over his head. He coined in his own name, established
his own <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>gaz</em></span> (measure), and  <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>ser</em></span> (weight), his own courts of justice,
and a new scale of rank for his chiefs, with nalkis and mace-bearers,

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Imperialist Attack on Ajmer.</h4>—“In 1778 the king determined
to regain Ajmer. He gave the command to Muzaffar, who in
the rains advanced towards Marwar. Ajit entrusted the conduct
of this war to his son, the ‘shield of Maru,’ the ‘fearless’ (Abhai),
with the eight great vassals, and thirty thousand horse; the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1027'>1027</span>Champawats on the right, the Kumpawats on the left, while the

Khichis, Dhondals and Gogawats,<a id='r5.9.32' /><a href='#f5.9.32' class='c013'><sup>[32]</sup></a> composed the main body.
At Amber, the Rathors and imperialists came in sight; but
Muzaffar disgraced himself, and retired within that city without
risking an encounter. Abhai Singh, exasperated at this display
of pusillanimous bravado, determined to punish the king. He
attacked Shahjahanpur, sacked Narnol, levied contributions on
Patan (Tuarvati) and Rewari.<a id='r5.9.33' /><a href='#f5.9.33' class='c013'><sup>[33]</sup></a> He gave the villages to the
flames, and spread conflagration and consternation even to
Allahwirdi’s Sarai. Delhi and Agra trembled with affright; the
Asurs fled without their shoes at the deeds of Abhai, whom they
styled Dhonkal, ‘the exterminator.’ He returned by Sambhar
and Ludhana, and here he married the daughter of the chief of
the Narukas.<a id='r5.9.34' /><a href='#f5.9.34' class='c013'><sup>[34]</sup></a></div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Muhammad Shah attacks Ajīt Singh.</h4>—“In 1779, Abhai Singh

‘Kasyapa and Surya’;<a id='r5.9.35' /><a href='#f5.9.35' class='c013'><sup>[35]</sup></a> for he had broken the bow of Muzaffar
and made the Hindu happy. The king sent his Chela, Nahar
Khan, to expostulate with Ajit; but his language was offensive,
and the field of Sambhar devoured the tiger lord (Nahar Khan)
and his four thousand followers. The son of Churaman the Jat<a id='r5.9.36' /><a href='#f5.9.36' class='c013'><sup>[36]</sup></a>
now claimed sanctuary with Ajit. Sick of these dissensions, the
unhappy Muhammad Shah determined to abandon his crown
and retire to Mecca. But, determined to revenge the death of
Nahar Khan, he prepared a formidable army. He collected
[the contingents of] the twenty-two Satraps<a id='r5.9.37' /><a href='#f5.9.37' class='c013'><sup>[37]</sup></a> of the empire, and
placed at their head Jai Singh of Amber, Haidar Kuli, Iradat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1028'>1028</span>Khan Bangash, etc. In the month of Sawan (July), Taragarh
was invested; Abhai Singh marched out and left its defence to
[91] Amra Singh. It had held out four months, when through
the prince of Amber (Jai Singh), Ajit listened to terms, which
were sworn to on the Koran by the nobles of the king; and he
agreed to surrender Ajmer.<a id='r5.9.38' /><a href='#f5.9.38' class='c013'><sup>[38]</sup></a> Abhai Singh then accompanied
Jai Singh to the camp. It was proposed that in testimony of
his obedience he should repair to the presence. The prince of
Amber pledged himself; but the Fearless (Abhai) placed his
hand on his sword, saying, ‘This is my surety!’”</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Ajīt Singh’s Heir received at the Imperial Court.</h4>—The heir of
Marwar was received by the king with the utmost honour; but
being possessed of a double portion of that arrogance which forms
the chief characteristic of his race (more especially of the Rathor
and Chauhan, from which he sprang), his reception nearly produced
at Delhi a repetition of the scene recorded in the history
of his ancestor Amra at Agra. Knowing that his father held
the first place on the king’s right hand, he considered himself,
as his representative, entitled to the same honour; and little
heeding the unbending etiquette of the proudest court in the
world, he unceremoniously hustled past all the dignitaries of
the State, and had even ascended a step of the throne, when,
checked by one of the nobles, Abhai’s hand was on his dagger,
and but for the presence of mind of the monarch, “who threw
his own chaplet round his neck” to restrain him, the Divan
would have been deluged with blood.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Murder of Ajīt Singh, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1724.</h4>—We shall now drop the
chronicles, and in recording the murder of Ajit, the foulest crime
in the annals of Rajasthan, exemplify the mode in which their
poetic historians gloss over such events. It was against Ajit’s
will that his son went to court, as if he had a presentiment of the
fate which awaited him, and which has been already circumstantially
related.<a id='r5.9.39' /><a href='#f5.9.39' class='c013'><sup>[39]</sup></a> The authors from whose records this narrative
is chiefly compiled, were too polite to suffer such a stigma to
appear in their chronicles, “written by desire” and under the
eye of the parricide, Ajit’s successor. The Surya Prakas merely
says, “at this time Ajit went to heaven”; but affords no indication
of the person who sent him there. The Raj Rupaka, however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1029'>1029</span>not bold enough to avow the mysterious death of his prince,
yet too honest altogether to pass it over, has left an expressive
blank leaf at this part of his chronicle, certainly not accidental,
as it intervenes between Abhai Singh’s reception at court, and
the incidents following his father’s death, which I translate
verbatim, as they present an excellent picture of the results of
a Rajput potentate’s demise [92].</div>

<p class='c001'>“Abhai, a second Ajit, was introduced to the Aspati; his
father heard the news and rejoiced. But this world is a fable—a
lie. Time will sooner or later prey on all things. What king,

allotted for our sojourn here is predetermined; prolong it we
cannot. The decree penned by the hand of the Creator is engraven
upon each forehead at the hour of birth. Neither addition nor
subtraction can be made. Fate (honhar) must be fulfilled. It
was the command of Govinda<a id='r5.9.40' /><a href='#f5.9.40' class='c013'><sup>[40]</sup></a> that Ajit (the Avatar of Indra)
should obtain immortality, and leave his renown in the world

to Parloka.<a id='r5.9.41' /><a href='#f5.9.41' class='c013'><sup>[41]</sup></a> He kept afloat the faith of the Hindu, and sunk
the Muslim in shame. In the face of day, the lord of Maru took
the road which leads to Paradise (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>Vaikuntha</em></span>). Then dismay
seized the city; each looked with dread in his neighbour’s face
as he said, ‘Our sun has set!’ But when the day of Yamaraj<a id='r5.9.42' /><a href='#f5.9.42' class='c013'><sup>[42]</sup></a>

escape?</p>

made obeisance to their lord in his car. The ministers, the bards,

the house of flame, ascended to the sky, the assembled multitudes
shouted Kaman! Kaman! ‘Well done! Well done!’ The

in doing honour to these faithful queens. Forty-five years,
three months, and twenty-two days, was the space of Ajit’s

abode!”</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Character of Ajīt Singh.</h4>—Thus closed the career of one of the
most distinguished princes who ever pressed the ‘cushion’ of
Maru; a career as full of incident as any life of equal duration.
Born amidst the snows of Kabul, deprived at his birth of both
parents, one from grief, the other by suicidal custom; saved
from the Herodian cruelty of the king by the heroism of his
chiefs, nursed amidst the rocks of Abu or the intricacies of the
Aravalli until the day of danger passed, he issued forth, still an
infant, at the head of his brave clans, to redeem the inheritance
so iniquitously wrested from him. In the history of mankind
there is nothing to be found presenting a more brilliant picture
of fidelity than that afforded by the Rathor clans in their devotion
to their prince, from his birth until he worked out his own and
his country’s deliverance. It is one of those events which throw
a gleam of splendour upon the dark picture of feudalism, more
prolific perhaps in crime than in virtue. That of the Rajputs,
indeed, in which consanguinity is superadded to the other reciprocal
[95] ties which bind a feudal body, wears the more engaging
aspect of a vast family. How affecting is the simple language of
these brave men, while daily shedding their blood for a prince
whom, until he had attained his seventh year, they had never
beheld! “Without the sight of our lord, bread and water have
no flavour.” And how successfully does the bard portray the
joy of these stern warriors, when he says, “As the lotus expands
at the sunbeam, so did the heart of each Rathor at the sight of
their infant sovereign; they drank his looks even as the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>papiha</em></span>
in the month of Asoj sips the drops of <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>amrita</em></span> (ambrosia) from the
<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>Champa</em></span>.”</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1033'>1033</span>The prodigality with which every clan lavished its blood,
through a space of six-and-twenty years, may in part be learned
from the chronicle; and in yet more forcible language from the
cenotaphs scattered over the country, erected to the manes of
those who fell in this religious warfare. Were other testimony
required, it is to be found in the annals of their neighbours and
their conquerors; while the traditional couplets of the bards,
familiar to every Rajput, embalm the memory of the exploits
of their forefathers.</p>

<p class='c001'>Ajit was a prince of great vigour of mind as well as of frame.
Valour was his inheritance; he displayed this hereditary quality
at the early age of eleven, when he visited his enemy in his capital,
displaying a courtesy which can only be comprehended by a
Rajput. Amongst the numerous desultory actions, of which
many occurred every year, there were several in which the whole
strength of the Rathors was led by their prince. The battle of
Sambhar, in S. 1765, fought against the Sayyids, which ended
in a union of interests, was one of these; and, for the rest of Ajit’s
life, kept him in close contact with the court, where he might
have taken the lead had his talent for intrigue been commensurate
with his boldness. From this period until his death, Ajit’s agency
was recognized in all the intrigues and changes amongst the
occupants of Timur’s throne, from Farrukhsiyar to Muhammad.
He inherited an invincible hatred to the very name of Muslim,
and was not scrupulous regarding the means by which he was
likely to secure the extirpation of a race so inimical to his own.
Viewing the manifold reasons for this hatred, we must not
scrutinize with severity his actions when leagued with the Sayyids,
even in the dreadful catastrophe which overwhelmed Farrukhsiyar,
to whom he owed the twofold duty of fealty and consanguinity.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>His Conduct to Durgadās.</h4>—There is one stain on the memory
of Ajit which, though unnoticed in the chronicle [96], is too well
ascertained to be omitted in a summary of his character, more
especially as it illustrates that of the nation and of the times, and
shows the loose system which holds such governments together.
The heroic Durgadas, the preserver of his infancy, the instructor
of his youth, the guide of his manhood, lived to confirm the
proverb, “Put not thy faith in princes.” He, who, by repeated
instances of exalted self-denial, had refused wealth and honours
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1034'>1034</span>that might have raised himself from his vassal condition to an
equality with his sovereign, was banished from the land which
his integrity, wisdom, and valour had preserved. Why, or when,
Ajit loaded himself with this indelible infamy was not known;
the fact was incidentally discovered in searching a collection of
original newspapers written from the camp of Bahadur Shah,<a id='r5.9.63' /><a href='#f5.9.63' class='c013'><sup>[63]</sup></a>
in one of which it was stated, that “Durgadas was encamped
with his household retainers on the banks of the Pichola Lake at
Udaipur, and receiving daily five hundred rupees for his support
from the Rana; who when called on by the king (Bahadur Shah)
to surrender him, magnanimously refused.” Imagining that
Ajit had been compelled to this painful sacrifice, which is not
noticed in the annals, the compiler mentioned it to a Yati deeply
versed in all the events and transactions of this State. Aware
of the circumstance, which is not overlooked by the bards, he
immediately repeated the couplet composed on the occasion—</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Gamgani, on the north bank of the Luni, was the chief town
of the Karanot fief, of which clan Durga was the head. It is
now attached to the Khalisa, or fisc, but whether recently, or
ever since Durga, we know not. The Karanots still pay the last
rites to their dead at Gamgani, where they have their cenotaphs
(<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>chhatris</em></span>). Whether that of the noble Durga stands there to
serve as a memorial of princely ingratitude, the writer cannot say;
a portrait of the hero, in the autumn of his days, was given to
him by the last lineal descendant of Ajit, as the reader is already
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1035'>1035</span>aware.<a id='r5.9.65' /><a href='#f5.9.65' class='c013'><sup>[65]</sup></a> Well may we repeat, that the system of feudality is
the parent of the most brilliant virtues and the darkest crimes.
Here, a long life of uninterrupted fidelity could not preserve
Durga from the envenomed breath of slander, or the serpent-tooth
[97] of ingratitude: and whilst the mind revolts at the
crime which left a blank leaf in the chronicle, it is involuntarily
carried back to an act less atrocious, indeed, than one which
violates the laws of nature, but which in diminishing none of our
horror for Abhai Singh, yet lessens our sympathy for the persecutor

the creator; the witness; the resting-place; the asylum; and
the friend. I am generation and dissolution; the place where all things
are deposited, and the inexhaustible soul of all nature. I am death and
immortality; I am never-failing time; the preserver, whose face is turned
on all sides. I am all grasping death; and I am the resurrection of those
who are about to die.”</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Mahārāja Abhai Singh, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1724-50.</h4>—The parricidal murder
of Ajit is accounted the germ of destruction, which, taking root
in the social edifice of Marwar, ultimately rent it asunder. Bitter
has been the fruit of this crime, “even unto the third and fourth
generation” of his unnatural sons, whose issue, but for this crime,
would in all human probability have been the most potent princes
in India, able single-handed to have stopped Mahratta aggrandisement.</div>

<p class='c001'>“It was in 1781 (says the bard) Ajit went to heaven. With
his own hand did the emperor Muhammad Shah put the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>tika</em></span> on
the forehead of Abhai Singh, girded him with the sword, bound
the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>turah</em></span><a id='r5.10.1' /><a href='#f5.10.1' class='c013'><sup>[1]</sup></a> on his head, placed a dagger set with gems [98] in his
girdle, and with Chaunris, Naubats, and Nakkaras,<a id='r5.10.2' /><a href='#f5.10.2' class='c013'><sup>[2]</sup></a> and many
valuable gifts, invested the young prince in all the dignities of
his father. Even Nagor was resumed from the son of Amra and
included in his sanad. With these marks of royal favour, he
took leave of the court, and returned to his paternal dominions.
From village to village, as he journeyed homeward, the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>kalas</em></span>
was raised on the head.<a id='r5.10.3' /><a href='#f5.10.3' class='c013'><sup>[3]</sup></a> When he reached Jodhpur, he distributed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1036'>1036</span>gifts to all his chiefs, and to the Bardais (bards and
Charans), and lands to the family priests (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>Purohits</em></span>).”</p>

<p class='c001'>A day at the court of the desert king, related in the phraseology
of the chronicle, would be deemed interesting as a picture of
manners. It would also make the reader more familiar with
Karna, the most celebrated bard in the latter days of Rajput
independence: but this must be reserved for an equally appropriate
vehicle,<a id='r5.10.4' /><a href='#f5.10.4' class='c013'><sup>[4]</sup></a> and we shall at present rest satisfied with a slight
sketch of the historian of Maru.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Karan, the Bard.</h4>—Karna-Kavya, or simply Karna, who traced
his descent from the last household bard of the last emperor of
Kanauj, was at once a politician, a warrior, and a scholar, and
in each capacity has left ample proofs of his abilities. In the
first he took a distinguished part in all the events of the civil
wars; in the second, he was one of the few who survived a combat
almost without parallel in the annals even of Rajput chivalry;
and as a scholar, he has left us, in the introduction to his work,<a id='r5.10.5' /><a href='#f5.10.5' class='c013'><sup>[5]</sup></a>
the most instructive proof, not only of his inheriting the poetic
mantle of his fathers, but of the course he pursued for the maintenance
of its lustre. The bare enumeration of the works he had
studied evinces that there was no royal road to Parnassus for the
Rajput Kaviswar,<a id='r5.10.6' /><a href='#f5.10.6' class='c013'><sup>[6]</sup></a> but that, on the contrary, it was beset with
difficulties not a little appalling. The mere nomenclature of
works on grammar and historical epics, which were to be mastered
ere he could hope for fame, must have often made Kama exclaim,
“How hard it is to climb the steeps” on which from afar he
viewed her temple. Those who desire to see, under a new aspect,
an imperfectly known but interesting family of the human race,
will be made acquainted with the qualifications of our bardic
historians, and the particular course of studies which [99] fitted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1037'>1037</span>Karna “to sit in the gate<a id='r5.10.7' /><a href='#f5.10.7' class='c013'><sup>[7]</sup></a> of Jodhagir,” and add a new book
to the chronicles of its kings.</div>

<p class='c001'>These festivities of the new reign were not of long duration,
and were succeeded by warlike preparations against Nagor,
which, during the contentions between Ajit and the emperor,
had been assigned to the descendant of the ancient princes of
Mandor.</p>

<p class='c001'>“When Ajmer was invested by the collective force of the
empire,<a id='r5.10.8' /><a href='#f5.10.8' class='c013'><sup>[8]</sup></a> Iradat Khan (Bangash), collector of the Jizya,<a id='r5.10.9' /><a href='#f5.10.9' class='c013'><sup>[9]</sup></a> took
the Indha by the arm, and seated him in Nagor.<a id='r5.10.10' /><a href='#f5.10.10' class='c013'><sup>[10]</sup></a> But as soon
as the Holi<a id='r5.10.11' /><a href='#f5.10.11' class='c013'><sup>[11]</sup></a> was past, the ‘Avatars of Jawalamukhi’<a id='r5.10.12' /><a href='#f5.10.12' class='c013'><sup>[12]</sup></a> were
consecrated: goats were sacrificed, and the blood, with oil and
vermilion, was sprinkled upon them. The tents were moved out.
Hearing this, Rao Indra produced the imperial patent, with the
personal guarantee of Jai Singh of Amber. Abhai heeded not,
and invested Nagor; but Indra left his honour and his castle
to the Fearless,<a id='r5.10.13' /><a href='#f5.10.13' class='c013'><sup>[13]</sup></a> who bestowed it on Bakhta his brother. He
received the congratulations of Mewar, Jaisalmer, Bikaner, and
Amber, and returned to his capital amidst the rejoicings of his
subjects. This was in S. 1781.</p>

<p class='c001'>“In S. 1782 he was employed in restraining the turbulent
Bhumias on the western frontiers of his dominions; when the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1038'>1038</span>Sindhals, the Deoras, the Balas, the Boras, the Balechas, and the
Sodhas were compelled to servitude.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Abhai Singh summoned to Delhi, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1726.</h4>—“In S. 1783 a
farman of summons arrived, calling the prince to attend the
Presence at Delhi. He put it to his head, assembled all his chiefs,
and on his passage to court made a tour of his dominions, examining
his garrisons, redressing [100] wrongs, and adjusting whatever
was in disorder. At Parbatsar<a id='r5.10.14' /><a href='#f5.10.14' class='c013'><sup>[14]</sup></a> he was attacked by
the small-pox: the nation called on Jagrani<a id='r5.10.15' /><a href='#f5.10.15' class='c013'><sup>[15]</sup></a> to shield him
from evil.</div>

<p class='c001'>“In 1784 the prince reached Delhi. Khandauran, the chief
noble of the empire, was deputed by the emperor to conduct him
to the capital; and when he reached the Presence, his majesty
called him close to his person, exclaiming, ‘Welcome, <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>Khushbakht</em></span>,<a id='r5.10.16' /><a href='#f5.10.16' class='c013'><sup>[16]</sup></a>

makes me happy; the splendour of the Ammkhass is redoubled.’
When he took leave, the king sent to his quarters, at Abhaipur,
choice fruits of the north, fragrant oils, and rose-water.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The prince of Maru was placed at the head of all the nobility.
About the end of S. 1784, Sarbuland Khan’s rebellion broke out,<a id='r5.10.18' /><a href='#f5.10.18' class='c013'><sup>[18]</sup></a>
which gave ample scope for the valour of the Rathors and materials
for the bard, who thus circumstantially relates it:</p>

<p class='c001'>“The troubles in the Deccan increased. The Shahzada
Jangali<a id='r5.10.19' /><a href='#f5.10.19' class='c013'><sup>[19]</sup></a> rebelled, and forming an army of sixty thousand men,
attacked the provincial governors of Malwa, Surat, and Ahmadpur,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1039'>1039</span>slaying the king’s lieutenants, Girdhar Bahadur, Ibrahim Kuli,<a id='r5.10.20' /><a href='#f5.10.20' class='c013'><sup>[20]</sup></a>
Rustam Ali, and the Mogul Shujaat.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Rebellion of Sarbuland Khan. Scene at the Imperial Court.</h4>—“Hearing
this, the king appointed Sarbuland Khan to quash the
rebellion. He marched at the head of fifty thousand men, having
a crore of rupees for their subsistence; but his advanced army
of ten thousand men being defeated in the first encounter, he
entered into terms with the rebels, and agreed to a partition of
the country.”</div>

<p class='c001'>It was at this time the prince of Marwar begged permission to
retire to his hereditary dominions. The bard’s description of
the court, and of the emperor’s distress on this occasion, though
prolix, deserves insertion:</p>

<p class='c001'>“The king was seated on his throne, attended by the seventy-two
grand Omras of the empire, when tidings reached him of
the revolt of Sarbuland. There was the wazir Kamaru-din Khan,
Itimadu-Daula, Khandauran, commander-in-chief [101] (Mir
Bakhshi), Samsamu-d-daula, the Amiru-Umara, Mansur Ali,
Roshanu-d-daula, Tura Baz Khan, the Lord Marcher (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>Sim ka

Murshid Kuli Khan, Ja’far Khan, Allahwirdi Khan,<a id='r5.10.22' /><a href='#f5.10.22' class='c013'><sup>[22]</sup></a> Muzaffar
Khan, governor of Ajmer. Such and many more were assembled
in the Presence.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It was read aloud that Sarbuland had reduced Gujarat,
and proclaimed his own <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>an</em></span>; that he had ground the Kolis to
dust; that he had vanquished the Mandalas, the Jhalas, the
Chudasamas, the Baghels, and the Gohils, and had nearly exterminated
the Balas; that Halar had agreed to pay tribute, and
that such was the fire of this Yavan, that the Bhumias of themselves
abandoned their strongholds to seek sanctuary with him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1040'>1040</span>whom the ‘seventeen thousand’<a id='r5.10.23' /><a href='#f5.10.23' class='c013'><sup>[23]</sup></a> now called sovereign; that
he had set himself up a king in Ahmadabad, and made a league
with the ‘Southron.’</p>

<p class='c001'>“The emperor saw that if this defection was not quelled, all
the viceroys would declare themselves independent. Already
had Jagaria Khan in the north, Saadat Khan in the east, and
the Mlechchha Nizamu-l-mulk in the south, shown the blackness
of their designs. The <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>tap</em></span> (verve) of the empire had fled.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>bira</em></span> was placed on a golden salver, which the Mir Tajik
bore in his extended arms, slowly passing in front of the nobles
ranged on either side of the throne, mighty men, at the sight of
whose faces the rustic would tremble: but in vain he passed both
lines; no hand was stretched forth; some looked awry; some
trembled; but none cast an eye upon the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>bira</em></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The ‘almighty monarch’ (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>Parameswar Padshah</em></span>), who could
make the beggar an Omra of twelve thousand, and the noble of
twelve thousand a beggar, was without resource. ‘Who,’ said
one, ‘would grasp the forked lightning, let him engage Sarbuland!’
Another exclaimed, ‘Who would seize the vessel, and plunge
with her in the whirlpool, he may contend with Sarbuland.’
And a third, ‘Whoever [102] dare seize the forked tongue of the
serpent, let him engage Sarbuland.’ The king was troubled;
he gave a sign to the Mir Tajik to return the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>bira</em></span> to him.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The Rathor prince saw the monarch’s distress, and as he
was about to leave the Ammkhass, he stretched forth his hand, and
placed the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>bira</em></span> in his turban, as he said, ‘Be not cast down, O
king of the world; I will pluck down this Sarbuland:<a id='r5.10.24' /><a href='#f5.10.24' class='c013'><sup>[24]</sup></a> leafless
shall be the boughs of his ambition, and his head (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>sar</em></span>) the forfeit
of his arrogant exaltation (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>buland</em></span>).’</p>

<p class='c001'>“When Abhai Singh grasped the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>bira</em></span>, the breasts of the
mighty were ready to burst with the fulness of envy, even like the
ripe pomegranate, as the king placed the grant of Gujarat into
the hands of the Rathor. The Shah’s heart was rejoiced, as he
said, ‘Thus acted your ancestors in support of the throne; thus
was quelled the revolt of Khurram and Bhim in the time of
Jahangir; that of the Deccan settled; and in like manner do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1041'>1041</span>I trust that by you the honour and the throne of Muhammad
Shah will be upheld.’</p>

<p class='c001'>“Rich gifts, including seven gems of great price, were bestowed
upon the Rathor; the treasury was unlocked and thirty-one
lakhs of coin were assigned for the troops. The guns were taken
from the arsenals, and with the patent of the vice-royalties of
Ahmadabad and Ajmer, in the month of Asarh (1786), Abhai
took leave of the king.”<a id='r5.10.25' /><a href='#f5.10.25' class='c013'><sup>[25]</sup></a></p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Abhai Singh starts for Gujarat, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1730.</h4>—The political
arrondissement of Marwar dates from this period; for the rebellion
of Sarbuland was the forerunner of the disintegration of the empire.
It was in June <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1730 that the prince of Marwar left the court
of Delhi. He had a double motive in proceeding direct to Ajmer,
of which province he was viceroy; first, to take possession of
his stronghold (the key not only of Marwar but of every State
in Rajputana); and second, to consult with the prince of Amber
on the affairs of that critical conjuncture. What was the cause
of Jai Singh’s presence at Ajmer the chronicle says not; but
from circumstances elsewhere related, it may be conjectured that
it was for the purpose of celebrating “the rites of the Pitrideva”
(manes of his ancestors) at Pushkar. The bard gives a most
prolix account of the meeting, even to the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>pagtar</em></span>, ‘or foot-clothes’
spread for “the kings of the Hindus” to walk on, “who feasted
together, and together plotted the destruction of the [103] empire”:
from which we perceive that Karna, the bard, had a peep behind
the curtain.</div>

<p class='c001'>Having installed his officers in Ajmer, Abhai Singh proceeded
to Merta, when he was met by his brother, Bakhta Singh, on
which occasion the grant of Nagor was bestowed upon the latter.
The brothers continued their route to the capital, when all the
chiefs were dismissed to their homes with injunctions to assemble
their vassals for the ensuing campaign against Sarbuland. At
the appointed time, the Kher (feudal array) of Marwar assembled
under the walls of Jodhpur. The occasion is a delightful one to
the bard, who revels in all “the pomp and circumstance of war”:
from the initiatory ceremony, the moving out the tents, to the
consecration of the ‘mighty tubes’ (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>balwannal</em></span>), the ‘volcanos
of the field,’ or, as he terms them, the ‘crocodile-mouths’ (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>magarmukhan</em></span>),
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1042'>1042</span>‘emblems of Yama,’ which were sprinkled abundantly
with the blood of goats slain under their muzzles. He describes
each clan as it arrives, their steeds, and caparisons.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Abhai Singh attacks Sirohi.</h4>—Instead, however, of proceeding
direct to the main object of the war, Abhai Singh took advantage
of the immense army thus placed under his command, as viceroy
of Gujarat, to wreak his own vengeance upon his neighbour, the
gallant prince of Sirohi, who, trusting to his native strength, had
spurned every compromise which involved his independence.
This resolution he maintained by his natural position, strengthened
by alliances with the aboriginal races who hemmed his little State
on all sides, excepting that towards Marwar.</div>

<p class='c001'>These Minas, the mountaineers of the Aravalli, had given
offence to Abhai Singh; for while the prince, between his arrival
at Jodhpur and the assemblage of the Kher, gave himself up to
indolence and opium, they carried off the whole cattle of the
train to the mountains. When this was reported to Abhai Singh,
he coolly said, “Let them go, they knew we were short of forage,
and have only taken them to their own pastures in the mountains.”
Strange to say, they did return them, and in excellent condition,
as soon as he prepared to march. When he heard of this,
he observed, “Did I not tell you these Minas were faithful
subjects?”</p>

<p class='c001'>The order to march was now given, when the bard enumerates
the names and strength of the different Rajput princes, whose
contingents formed this array, in which there were only two
Muhammadan leaders of distinction: “The Haras of Kotah
and Bundi; the Khichis of Gagraun; the Gaurs of Sheopur;
the Kachhwahas of [104] Amber, and [even] the Sodhas of the
desert, under their respective princes or chiefs, were under the
command of the Marwar prince. His native retainers, the united
clans of Marwar, formed the right wing of the whole army, headed
by his brother Bakhta.</p>

<p class='c001'>“On the 10th Chait (Sudi) S. 1786, Abhai marched from
Jodhpur, by Bhadrajun and Malgarh, Siwana and Jalor. Rewara
was assaulted; the swords of the enemy showered, and the Champawat
fell amidst heaps of slain. The Deoras abandoned the hill
and fled. The trees were levelled to the summit; a garrison
was posted, and the array moved on to Pusalia. Then Abu
shook with affright. Affliction seized Sirohi; its prince was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1043'>1043</span>in despair when he heard Rewara and Pusalia were destroyed.<a id='r5.10.26' /><a href='#f5.10.26' class='c013'><sup>[26]</sup></a>
The Chauhan preferred decking his daughter in the bridal vestments
to arraying his army to oppose Abhaimall.”</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Submission of Sirohi to Abhai Singh.</h4>—Rao Narayan Das,
through the intervention of a Rajput chieftain, named Mayaram,
of the Chawara tribe, made overtures to the Rathor, proposing
his niece (daughter of Man Singh his predecessor) in marriage.<a id='r5.10.27' /><a href='#f5.10.27' class='c013'><sup>[27]</sup></a>
“In the midst of strife ‘the coco-nut,’ with eight choice steeds
and the price of four elephants, were sent and accepted. The
drum of battle ceased; the nuptials were solemnized, and in the
tenth month Ram Singh was born at Jodhpur.” The bard, however,
lets us into the secret, and shows that the Rajputs had
‘secret articles,’ as well as the more polished diplomacy of Europe;
for besides the fair Chauhani, the Rao consented to pay Peshachchanni
a ‘concealed tribute.’</div>

<p class='c001'>The Deora chiefs united their contingents to the royal army,
for the subjugation of Sarbuland, and the march recommenced
by Palanpur and Siddhpur, or the Sarasvati. Here they halted,
and “an envoy was dispatched to Sarbuland, summoning him
to surrender the imperial equipments, cannons, and stores; to
account for the revenues, and to withdraw his garrisons from
Ahmadabad and all the strongholds of the province.” The reply
was laconic and dignified; “that he himself was king, and his
head was with Ahmadabad” [105].</p>

<p class='c001'>A grand council of war was convened in the Rajput camp,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1044'>1044</span>which is described <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><em>con amore</em></span> by the bard. The overture and its
reception were communicated, and the debates and speeches
which ensued thereon, as to the future course of proceeding, are
detailed. The bard is, however, satisfied with recording the
speeches of ‘the chiefs of the eight grades of Maru.’</p>

<p class='c001'>“First spoke the chief of the children of Champa, Kusal, son
of Harnath of Awa, whose seat is on the right of the throne.
Then Kanairam of Asop, leader of the Kumpawats, whose place
is on the left: ‘let us, like the Kilkila,<a id='r5.10.28' /><a href='#f5.10.28' class='c013'><sup>[28]</sup></a> dive into the waters of
battle.’ He was followed by Kesari, the Mertia Sarmor—then
by the veteran who led the Udawats: old and brave, many a
battle had he seen. Then the chief of Khanua, who led the clan
of Jodha, protested he would be the first to claim the immortal
garland from the hand of the Apsaras:<a id='r5.10.29' /><a href='#f5.10.29' class='c013'><sup>[29]</sup></a> ‘Let us stain our garments
with saffron, and our lances with crimson, and play at ball with

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Battle with Sarbuland.</h4>—Sarbuland’s plans of defence are
minutely detailed. At each gate he posted two thousand men
and five guns, “manned by Europeans,” of whom he had a body
of musketeers round his person. The cannonade had been kept
up three days on both sides, in which the son of Sarbuland was
killed. At length, Bakhta led the storm, when all the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>ots</em></span> and
<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>awats</em></span> performed prodigies of valour. The Champawat Kusal
was the first to be carried to the “immortal abode”; but though
“the sun stood still to see the deeds of the son of Harnath” we
cannot particularize the bard’s catalogue of heroes transferred
to Suryaloka<a id='r5.10.34' /><a href='#f5.10.34' class='c013'><sup>[34]</sup></a> on this day, when the best blood of Rajputana
was shed on the walls of Ahmadabad. Both the princely brothers
had their share in “the play of swords,” and each slew more
than one leader of note. Amra, who had so often defended
Ajmer, slew five chiefs of the grades of two and three thousand
horse.</div>

<p class='c001'>“Eight gharis of the day remained, when Sarbuland fled;
but Aliyar, the leader of his vanguard, made a desperate resistance,
until he fell by the hand of Bakhta Singh. The drum of victory
sounded. The Nawab left his <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>pani</em></span> in the Rankund.<a id='r5.10.35' /><a href='#f5.10.35' class='c013'><sup>[35]</sup></a> The

<h3 class='c024'>CHAPTER 11</h3>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Jealousy of Abhai Singh to Bakht Singh.</h4>—The tranquillity
which for a while followed the campaign in Gujarat was of no
long duration. The love of ease and opium, which increased
with the years of Abhai Singh, was disturbed by a perpetual
apprehension of the active courage and military genius of his
brother, whose appanage of Nagor was too restricted a field for
his talents and ambition. Bakhta was also aware that his daring
nature, which obtained him the suffrages, as it would the swords,
of his turbulent and easily excited countrymen, rendered him an
object of distrust, and that without great circumspection, he
would be unable to maintain himself in his <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>imperium in imperio</em></span>,
the castle and three hundred and sixty townships of Nagor. He
was too discreet to support himself by foreign aid, or by fomenting
domestic strife; but with the aid of the bard he adopted a line
of policy, the relation of which will develop new traits in the
Rajput character, and exemplify its peculiarities. Karna, after
finishing his historical chronicle, concluding with the war against
Sarbuland, abandoned “the gate of Jodhpur for that of Nagor.”
Like all his tribe, the bard was an adept in intrigue, and his sacred
character forwarded the secret means of executing it. His advice
was to embroil their common sovereign with the prince of Amber,
and an opportunity was not long wanting [109].</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Abhai Singh attacks Bīkaner.</h4>—The prince of Bikaner,<a id='r5.11.1' /><a href='#f5.11.1' class='c013'><sup>[1]</sup></a> a
junior but independent branch of Marwar, had offended his yet
nominal suzerain Abhai Singh, who, taking advantage of the
weakness of their common liege lord the emperor, determined
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1048'>1048</span>to resent the affront, and accordingly invested Bikaner, which
had sustained a siege of some weeks, when Bakhta determined
to make its release subserve his designs; nor could he have chosen
a better expedient. Although the prince of Marwar had led his
united vassalage against Bikaner, they were not only lukewarm
as to the success of their own arms, but, anomalous as it must
appear in the annals even of feudal warfare, they furnished the
besieged with the means of defence, who, but for the supplies of
opium, salt, and ammunition, would soon have been compelled
to surrender. We can account for this: Bikaner was of their
own kin, a branch of the great tree of which Siahji was the root,
and to which they could cling in emergency; in short, Bikaner
balanced the power between themselves and their head.</div>

<p class='c001'>The scheme being approved, its execution and mode of development
to Jai Singh were next canvassed. “Touch his pride,” said
Karna; “tell him the insult to Amber, which your ancestor
invested, has never been balanced, and that he will never find
a time like the present to fling a few shot at Jodhpur.”</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Bakht Singh intrigues to cause War with Jaipur.</h4>—Bakhta
addressed a letter to Jai Singh, and at the same time sent instructions
to the envoy of Bikaner at his court how to act.</div>

<p class='c001'>The prince of Amber, towards the close of his career, became
partial to ‘the cup’; but, aware of the follies it involved him in,
an edict prohibited all official intercourse with him while he was
under its influence. The direct overture of Bakhta was canvassed,
and all interference between the kindred belligerents was rejected
in a full council of the chiefs of Amber. But the envoy had a
friend in the famous Vidyadhar,<a id='r5.11.2' /><a href='#f5.11.2' class='c013'><sup>[2]</sup></a> the chief civil minister of the
State, through whose means he obtained permission to make ‘a
verbal report, standing.’ “Bikaner,” he said, “was in peril,
and without his aid must fall, and that his master did not consider
the sovereign of Marwar, but of Amber, as his suzerain.”
Vanity and wine did the rest. The prince took up the pen and
wrote to Abhai Singh, “That they all formed one great family;
to forgive Bikaner and raise his batteries”: and as he took
another cup, and [110] curled his moustache, he gave the letter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1049'>1049</span>to be folded. “Maharaja,” said the envoy, “put in two more
words: ‘or, my name is Jai Singh.’” They were added. The
overjoyed envoy retired, and in a few minutes the letter was on
transit to its destination by the swiftest camel of the desert.
Scarcely had the envoy retired, when the chief of Bansko,<a id='r5.11.3' /><a href='#f5.11.3' class='c013'><sup>[3]</sup></a> the
Mentor of Jai Singh, entered. He was told of the letter, which
“would vex his Saga.”<a id='r5.11.4' /><a href='#f5.11.4' class='c013'><sup>[4]</sup></a> The old chief remonstrated; he said,
“Unless you intend to extinguish the Kachhwahas, recall this
letter.” Messenger after messenger was sent, but the envoy
knew his duty. At the dinner hour all the chiefs had assembled
at the (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>Rasora</em></span>) banquet-hall, when the spokesman of the vassalage,
old Dip Singh, in reply to the communication of his sovereign,
told him he had done a cruel and wanton act, and that they must
all suffer for his imprudence.</p>

<p class='c001'>The reply, a laconic defiance, was brought back with like
celerity; it was opened and read by Jai Singh to his chiefs: “By
what right do you dictate to me, or interfere between me and my
servants? If your name is ‘Lion of Victory’ (Jai Singh), mine
is ‘the Lion without Fear’ (Abhai Singh).”<a id='r5.11.5' /><a href='#f5.11.5' class='c013'><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The ancient chief, Dip Singh, said: “I told you how it would
be; but there is no retreat, and our business is to collect our
friends.” The Kher, or ‘levy <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>en masse</em></span>,’ was proclaimed: Every
Kachhwaha was commanded to repair to the great standard
planted outside the capital. The home-clans came pouring in,
and aid was obtained from the Haras of Bundi, the Jadons of
Karauli, the Sesodias of Shahpura, the Khichis, and the Jats,
until one hundred thousand men were formed beneath the castle
of Amber. This formidable array proceeded, march after march,
until they reached Gangwana, a village on the frontier of Marwar.<a id='r5.11.6' /><a href='#f5.11.6' class='c013'><sup>[6]</sup></a>
Here they encamped, and, with all due courtesy, awaited the
arrival of the ‘Fearless Lion.’</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Battle of Gangwāna.</h4>—They were not long in suspense. Mortally
offended at such wanton interference, which compelled him
to relinquish his object on the very eve of attainment, Abhai
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1050'>1050</span>Singh raised his batteries from besieging Bikaner and rapidly
advanced to the encounter.</div>

<p class='c001'>Bakhta now took alarm. He had not calculated the length to
which his intrigues would involve his country; he had sought
but to embroil the border princes, but [111] had kindled a national
warfare. Still his fears were less for the discovery of his plot
than for the honour of Marwar, about to be assailed by such odds.
He repaired to his brother and liege lord, and implored him not
to raise the siege; declaring that he alone, with the vassals of
Nagor, would receive the Bhagatia’s<a id='r5.11.7' /><a href='#f5.11.7' class='c013'><sup>[7]</sup></a> battle, and, by God’s
blessing, would give a good account of him. Abhai Singh, not
averse to see his brother punished for his conduct, though determined
to leave him to the brunt of the battle, rejected with scorn
the intriguing proposition.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Nakkara sounded the assembly for the chivalry of
Nagor. Bakhta took post on the balcony over the Delhi gate,
with two brazen vessels; in the one was an infusion of opium,
in the other saffron-water. To each Rajput as he entered he
presented opium, and made the impress of his right hand on his
heart with the saffron-water. Having in this manner enrolled
eight thousand Rajputs, sworn to die with him, he determined
to select the most resolute; and marching to the edge of an
extensive field of luxuriant Indian corn<a id='r5.11.8' /><a href='#f5.11.8' class='c013'><sup>[8]</sup></a> (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>bajra</em></span>), he halted his
band, and thus addressed them: “Let none follow me who is
not prepared for victory or death: if there be any amongst you
who desire to return, let them do so in God’s name.” As he
spoke, he resumed the march through the luxuriant fields, that
it might not be seen who retired. More than five thousand
remained, and with these he moved on to the combat.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Amber prince awaited them at Gangwana: soon as the
hostile lines approached, Bakhta gave the word, and, in one dense
mass, his gallant legion charged with lance and sword the deepened
lines of Amber, carrying destruction at every pass. He passed
through and through this host; but when he pulled up in the
rear, only sixty of his band remained round his person. At this
moment the chief of Gajsinghpura, head of all his vassals, hinted
there was a jungle in the rear: “And what is there in front,” said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1051'>1051</span>the intrepid Rathor, “that we should not try the road we came?”
and as he espied the Panchranga, or five-coloured flag, which
denoted the headquarters of Amber, the word again was given.
The cautious Kumbhani<a id='r5.11.9' /><a href='#f5.11.9' class='c013'><sup>[9]</sup></a> advised his prince to avoid the charge:
with some difficulty he was made to leave the field, and as a
salvo to his honour, by a flank movement towards Kandela north,
that it might not be said he turned his back on his foe. As he
[112] retreated, he exclaimed, “Seventeen battles have I witnessed,
but till this day never one decided by the sword.” Thus,
after a life of success, the wisest, or at least the most learned and
most powerful prince of Rajwara, incurred the disgrace of leaving
the field in the face of a handful of men, strengthening the adage
“that one Rathor equalled ten Kachhwahas.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Jai Singh’s own bards could not refrain from awarding the
meed of valour to their foes, and composed the following stanzas
on the occasion: “Is it the battle cry of Kali, or the war-shout
of Hanumanta, or the hissing of Seshnag, or the denunciation of
Kapaliswar? Is it the incarnation of Narsingh, or the darting
beam of Surya? or the death-glance of the Dakini?<a id='r5.11.10' /><a href='#f5.11.10' class='c013'><sup>[10]</sup></a> or that
from the central orb of Trinetra?<a id='r5.11.11' /><a href='#f5.11.11' class='c013'><sup>[11]</sup></a> Who could support the
flames from this volcano of steel, when Bakhta’s sword became
the sickle of Time?”</p>

<p class='c001'>But for Karna the bard, one of the few remaining about his
person, Bakhta would a third time have plunged into the ranks
of the foe; nor was it till the host of Amber had left the field that
he was aware of the extent of his loss.<a id='r5.11.12' /><a href='#f5.11.12' class='c013'><sup>[12]</sup></a> Then, strange inconsistency!
the man, who but a few minutes before had affronted
death in every shape, when he beheld the paucity of survivors,
sat down and wept like an infant. Still it was more the weakness
of ambition than humanity; for, never imagining that his
brother would fail to support him, he thought destruction had
overtaken Marwar; nor was it until his brother joined and
assured him he had left him all the honour of the day, that he recovered
his port. Then “he curled his whiskers and swore an oath,
that he would yet drag the ‘Bhagat’ from his castle of Amber.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1052'>1052</span>Jai Singh, though he paid dear for his message, gained his
point, the relief of Bikaner; and the Rana of Udaipur mediated
to prevent the quarrel going further, which was the less difficult
since both parties had gained their ends, though Jai Singh obtained
his by the loss of a battle.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Marriage of a God.</h4>—It is related that the tutelary deity of
Bakhta Singh fell into the hands of the Amber prince, who carried
home the sole trophy he could boast, married the Rathor deity
to a female divinity of Amber, and returned him with his compliments
to Bakhta. Such were the courteous usages of Rajput
chivalry. The triple alliance [113] of the chief Rajput princes
followed this battle, cemented by the union of the rival houses
to daughters of Mewar. There they met, attended by their
vassalage, and, in the nuptial festivities and the ‘cup,’ forgot
this bitter strife, while enmity and even national jealousy were
banished by general courtesy. Such is the Rajput, who can
be judged after no known standard: he stands alone in the
moral history of man.<a id='r5.11.13' /><a href='#f5.11.13' class='c013'><sup>[13]</sup></a></div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Death and Character of Abhai Singh.</h4>—This is the last conspicuous
act of Abhai Singh’s life on record. He died in S. 1806
(<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1750) at Jodhpur. His courage, which may be termed
ferocious, was tempered only by his excessive indolence, regarding
which they have preserved many amusing anecdotes; one of
these will display the exact character of the man. The chronicle
says: “When Ajit went to marry the Chauhani, he found two
lions in his path—the one asleep, the other awake. The interpretation
of the Saguni (augur) was, that the Chauhani would
bear him two sons; that one would be a <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>soti kan</em></span> (sluggard), the
other an active soldier.” Could the augur have revealed that
they would imbrue their hands in a father’s blood, he might have
averted the ruin of his country, which dates from this black deed.</div>

<p class='c001'>The Rathors profess a great contempt for the Kachhwahas as
soldiers; and Abhai Singh’s was not lessened for their prince,
because he happened to be father-in-law to the prince of Amber,
whom he used to mortify, even in the ‘Presence,’ with such
sarcasm as, “You are called a Kachhua, or properly Kuswa,
from the Kusa; and your sword will cut as deep as one of its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1053'>1053</span>blades”:<a id='r5.11.14' /><a href='#f5.11.14' class='c013'><sup>[14]</sup></a> alluding to the grass thus called. Irritated, yet
fearing to reply, he formed a plan to humble his arrogance in his
only vulnerable point, the depreciation of his personal strength.
While it was the boast of Jai Singh to mingle the exact sciences
of Europe with the more ancient of India, Abhai’s ambition was
to be deemed the first swordsman of Rajwara. The scientific
prince of Amber gave his cue to Kirparam, the paymaster-general,
a favourite with the king, from his skill at chess, and who had
often the honour of playing with him while all the nobles were
standing. Kirparam praised the Rathor prince’s dexterity in
smiting off a buffalo’s head; on which the king called out, “Rajeswar,
I have heard much of your skill with the sword.” “Yes,
Hazrat, I can use it on an occasion.” A huge animal [114] was
brought into the area, fed in the luxuriant pastures of Hariana.
The court crowded out to see the Rathor exhibit; but when he
beheld the enormous bulk, he turned to the king and begged
permission to retire to his post, the imperial guardroom, to refresh
himself. Taking a double dose of opium, he returned, his
eyes glaring with rage at the trick played upon him, and as he
approached the buffalo they fell upon Jai Singh who had procured
this monster with a view to foil him. The Amber chief saw that
mischief was brewing, and whispered his majesty not to approach
too near his son-in-law. Grasping his sword in both hands,
Abhai gave the blow with such force that the buffalo’s head
“dropped upon his knees,” and the raja was thrown upon his
back. All was well; but, as the chronicle says, “the king never
asked the raja to decollate another buffalo.”</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Invasion of Nādir Shāh.</h4>—It was during the reign of Abhai
Singh that Nadir Shah<a id='r5.11.15' /><a href='#f5.11.15' class='c013'><sup>[15]</sup></a> invaded India; but the summons to the
Rajput princes, to put forth their strength in support of the
tottering throne of Timur, was received with indifference. Not
a chief of note led his myrmidons to the plains of Karnal; and
Delhi was invested, plundered, and its monarch dethroned, without
exciting a sigh. Such was their apathy in the cause, when the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1054'>1054</span>imbecility of Muhammad Shah succeeded to the inheritance of
Aurangzeb, that with their own hands these puppets of despotism
sapped the foundations of the empire.</div>

<p class='c001'>Unfortunately for Rajputana, the demoralization of her princes
prevented their turning to advantage this depression of the
empire, in whose follies and crimes they participated.</p>

<p class='c001'>With the foul and monstrous murder of the Raja Ajit (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span>
1750) commenced those bloody scenes which disgrace the annals
of Marwar; yet even in the history of her crimes there are acts of
redeeming virtue, which raise a sentiment of regret that the lustre
of the one should be tarnished by the presence of the other. They
serve, however, to illustrate that great moral truth, that in every
stage of civilization crime will work out its own punishment;
and grievously has the parricidal murder of Ajit been visited on
his race and country. We shall see it acting as a blight on that
magnificent tree, which, transplanted from the native soil of the
Ganges, took root and flourished amidst the arid sands of the
desert, affording a goodly shade for a daring race, who acquired
fresh victories with poverty—we shall see its luxuriance checked,
and its numerous and widely spread branches, as if [115] scorched
by the lightnings of heaven, wither and decay; and they must
utterly perish, unless a scion, from the uncontaminated stem of
Idar,<a id='r5.11.16' /><a href='#f5.11.16' class='c013'><sup>[16]</sup></a> be grafted upon it: then it may revive, and be yet made
to yield more vigorous fruit.</p>

<h3 class='c024'>CHAPTER 12</h3>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Rāja Rām Singh, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1750-52.</h4>—Ram Singh succeeded at
that dangerous age when parental control is most required to
restrain the turbulence of passion. Exactly twenty years had
elapsed since the nuptials at Sirohi, when Hymen extinguished
the torch of discord, and his mother was the bearer of the olive
branch to Abhai Singh, to save her house from destruction. The
Rajput, who attaches everything to pedigree, has a right to lay
an interdict on the union of the race of Agni,<a id='r5.12.1' /><a href='#f5.12.1' class='c013'><sup>[1]</sup></a> with the already too
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1055'>1055</span>fiery blood of the Rathor. Ram Singh inherited the arrogance
of his father, with all the impetuosity of the Chauhans; and the
exhibition of these qualities was simultaneous with his coronation.
We are not told why his uncle, Bakhta Singh, absented himself
from the ceremony of his prince’s and nephew’s installation,
when the whole kin and clans of Maru assembled to ratify their
allegiance by their presence. As the first in blood and rank, it
was his duty to make the first mark of inauguration on the [116]
forehead of his prince. The proxy he chose on the occasion was
his Dhai, or ‘nurse,’ a personage of no small importance in those
countries. Whether by such a representative the haughty
warrior meant to insinuate that his nephew should yet be in leading
strings, the chronicle affords us no hint; but it reprehends Ram
Singh’s conduct to this venerable personage, whom, instead of
treating, according to usage, with the same respect as his mother,
he asked, “if his uncle took him for an ape, that he sent an old
hag to present him with the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>tika</em></span>?” and instantly dispatched an
express desiring the surrender of Jalor. Ere his passion had time
to cool, he commanded his tents to be moved out, that he might
chastise the insult to his dignity. Despising the sober wisdom of
the counsellors of the state, he had given his confidence to one
of the lowest grade of these hereditary officers, by name Amia,
the Nakkarchi,<a id='r5.12.2' /><a href='#f5.12.2' class='c013'><sup>[2]</sup></a> a man headstrong like himself. The old chief
of the Champawats, on hearing of this act of madness, repaired
to the castle to remonstrate; but scarcely had he taken his seat
before the prince assailed him with ridicule, desiring “to see his
frightful face as seldom as possible.” “Young man,” exclaimed
the indignant chief, as with violence he dashed his shield reversed
upon the carpet, “you have given mortal offence to a Rathor,
who can turn Marwar upside down as easily as that shield.”
With eyes darting defiance, he arose and left the Presence, and
collecting his retainers, marched to Mundiavar.<a id='r5.12.3' /><a href='#f5.12.3' class='c013'><sup>[3]</sup></a> This was the
residence of the Pat-Bardai, or ‘chief bard,’ the lineal descendant
of the Bardai Roera, who left Kanauj with Siahji. The esteem
in which his sacred office was held may be appreciated by his
estate, which equalled that of the first noble, being one lakh of
rupees (£10,000) of revenue.</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1056'>1056</span>The politic Bakhta, hearing of the advance of the chief noble
of Maru on the border of his territory, left Nagor, and though it
was midnight, advanced to welcome him. The old chief was
asleep; Bakhta forbade his being disturbed, and placed himself
quietly beside his pallet. As he opened his eyes, he called as
usual for his pipe (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>hukka</em></span>), when the attendant pointing to the
prince, the old chief scrambled up. Sleep had cooled his rage,
and the full force of his position rushed upon him; but seeing
there was now no retreat, that the Rubicon was crossed, “Well,
there is my head,” said he; “now it is yours.” The bard, who
was present at the interview, was sounded by being requested to
bring the chief’s wife and family from [117] Awa to Nagor; and
he gave his assent in a manner characteristic of his profession:
“farewell to the gate of Jodhpur,” alluding to the station of
the bard. The prince immediately replied, “there was no difference
between the gate of Jodhpur and Nagor; and that while
he had a cake of <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>bajra</em></span> he would divide it with the bard.”</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Civil War between Rām Singh and Bakht Singh.</h4>—Ram Singh
did not allow his uncle much time to collect a force; and the
first encounter was at Kherli. Six actions rapidly followed;
the last was at Lunawas, on the plains of Merta, with immense
loss of life on both sides. This sanguinary battle has been already
related,<a id='r5.12.4' /><a href='#f5.12.4' class='c013'><sup>[4]</sup></a> in which Ram Singh was defeated, and forced to seek
safety in flight; when Jodhpur was surrendered, and Bakhta
invested with the Rajtilak and sword by the hands of the Jethawat
chief of Bagri, whose descendants continue to enjoy this distinction,
with the title of Marwar ka bar Kewar, ‘the bar to the
portal of Marwar.’</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Accession of Bakht Singh, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1752-53.</h4>—With the possession
of the seat of government, and the support of a great majority
of the clans, Bakhta Singh felt secure against all attempts of his
nephew to regain his lost power. But although his popularity
with his warlike kindred secured their suffrages for his maintenance
of the throne which the sword had gained him, there
were other opinions which Bakhta Singh was too politic to overlook.
The adhesion of the hereditary officers of the State,
especially those personal to the sovereign, is requisite to cloak the
crime of usurpation, in which light only, whatever the extent of
provocation, Bakhta’s conduct could be regarded. The military
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1057'>1057</span>premier, as well as the higher civil authorities, were won to his
cause, and of those whose sacred office might seem to sanctify
the crime, the chief bard had already changed his post “for the
gate of Nagor.” But there was one faithful servant, who, in
the general defection, overlooked the follies of his prince, in his
adherence to the abstract rules of fidelity; and who, while his
master found refuge at Jaipur, repaired to the Deccan to obtain
the aid of the Mahrattas, the mercenaries of Rajputana. Jaga
was the name of this person; his office, that of Purohit, the
ghostly adviser of his prince and tutor to his children. Bakhta,
at once desirous to obtain his suffrage, and to arrest the calamity
of foreign invasion, sent a couplet in his own hand to the
Purohit:</div>

<p class='c001'>“The flower, O bee, whose aroma regaled you, has been

<p class='c001'>Bakhta, to his honour, approved the fidelity which rejected
his overtures.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Intervention of Mahādaji Sindhia.</h4>—There was a joyousness of
soul about Bakhta which, united to an intrepidity and a liberality
alike unbounded, made him the very model of a Rajput. To
these qualifications were superadded a majestic mien and Herculean
frame, with a mind versed in all the literature of his country,
besides poetic talent of no mean order; and but for that one
damning crime, he would have been handed down to posterity as
one of the noblest princes Rajwara ever knew. These qualities
not only riveted the attachment of the household clans, but
secured the respect of all his exterior relations, so that when the
envoy of the expatriated prince obtained Sindhia’s aid for the
restoration of Ram Singh, the popularity of Bakhta formed an
army which appalled the “Southron,” who found arrayed against
him all the choice swords of Rajwara. The whole allodial power
of the desert, “the sons of Siahji” of every rank, rose to oppose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1058'>1058</span>this first attempt of the Mahrattas to interfere in their national
quarrels, and led by Bakhta in person, advanced to meet Mahadaji,
the Patel.<a id='r5.12.6' /><a href='#f5.12.6' class='c013'><sup>[6]</sup></a> But the Mahratta, whose object was plunder rather
than glory, satisfied that he had little chance of either, refused to
measure his lance (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>barchhi</em></span>) with the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>sang</em></span> and <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>sirohi</em></span><a id='r5.12.7' /><a href='#f5.12.7' class='c013'><sup>[7]</sup></a> of the
Rajput.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Bakht Singh Poisoned.</h4>—Poison effected what the sword
could not accomplish. Bakhta determined to remain encamped
in that vulnerable point of access to his dominions, the passes
near Ajmer. Hither, the Rathor queen of Madho Singh, prince
of Amber, repaired to compliment her relative, and to her was
entrusted the task of removing the enemy of her nephew, Ram
Singh. The mode in which the deed was effected, as well as the
last moments of the heroic but criminal Bakhta, have been already
related.<a id='r5.12.8' /><a href='#f5.12.8' class='c013'><sup>[8]</sup></a> He died in S. 1809 (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1753), leaving a disputed
succession, and all the horrors of impending civil strife, to his
son, Bijai Singh.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Repression of Islām.</h4>—During his three years of sovereignty,
Bakhta had found both time and resources to strengthen and
embellish the strongholds of Marwar. He completed the fortifications
[119] of the capital, and greatly added to the palace
of Jodha, from the spoils of Ahmadabad. He retaliated the injuries
on the intolerant Islamite, and threw down his shrines and
his mosques in his own fief of Nagor, and with the wrecks restored
the edifices of ancient days. It was Bakhta also who prohibited,
under pain of death, the Islamite’s call to prayer throughout his
dominions, and the order remains to this day unrevoked in Marwar.
Had he been spared a few years to direct the storm then accumulating,
which transferred power from the haughty Tatar of Delhi
to the peasant soldier of the Kistna, the probability was eminently
in favour of the Rajputs resuming their ancient rights throughout
India. Every principality had the same motive for union in one
common cause, the destruction of a power inimical to their
welfare: but crimes, moral and political, rendered an opportunity,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1059'>1059</span>such as never occurred in their history, unavailing for their
emancipation from temporal and spiritual oppression.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Rājput Morals compared with those of Europe in the Middle
Ages.</h4>—We will here pause, and anticipating the just horror of
the reader, at finding crime follow crime—one murder punished
by another—prevent his consigning all the Rajput dynasties to
infamy, because such foul stains appear in one part of their annals.
Let him cast his eyes over the page of western history; and commencing
with the period of Siahji’s emigration in the eleventh
century, when the curtain of darkness was withdrawn from
Europe, as it was simultaneously closing upon the Rajput,
contrast their respective moral characteristics. The Rajput
chieftain was imbued with all the kindred virtues of the western
cavalier, and far his superior in mental attainments. There is no
period on record when these Hindu princes could not have signed
their names to a charter; many of them could have drawn it up,
and even invested it, if required, in a poetic garb; and although
this consideration perhaps enhances, rather than palliates, crime,
what are the instances in these States, we may ask, compared
to the wholesale atrocities of the ‘Middle Ages’ of Europe?</div>

<p class='c001'>The reader would also be wrong if he leaped to the conclusion
that the bardic chronicler passed no judgment on the princely
criminal. His “empoisoned stanzas” (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>vishwa sloka</em></span>), transmitted
to posterity by the mouth of the peasant and the prince,
attest the reverse. One couplet has been recorded, stigmatizing
Bakhta for the murder of his father; there is another of the chief
bard, improvised while his prince Abhai Singh and Jai Singh of
Amber were passing the period devoted [120] to religious rites
at the sacred lake of Pushkar. These ceremonies never stood in
the way of festivity; and one evening, while these princes and
their vassals were in the height of merriment, the bard was
desired to contribute to it by some extemporaneous effusion.
He rose, and vociferated in the ears of the horror-struck assembly
the following quatrain:—</p>

<p class='c001'>The words of the poetic seer sank into the minds of his hearers,
and passed from mouth to mouth. They were probably the
severest vengeance either prince experienced in this world, and

<h3 class='c024'>CHAPTER 13</h3>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Rāja Bijai Singh, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1753-93.</h4>—Bijai Singh, then in his
twentieth year, succeeded his father, Bakhta. His accession
was acknowledged not only by the emperor, but by all the princes
around him, and he was inaugurated at the frontier town of
Marot,<a id='r5.13.1' /><a href='#f5.13.1' class='c013'><sup>[1]</sup></a> when proceeding to Merta, where he passed the period
of <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>matam</em></span> or mourning. Hither the independent branches of his
family, of Bikaner, Kishangarh, and Rupnagarh, came simultaneously
with their condolence and congratulations. Thence he
advanced to the capital, and concluded the rites on death and
accession with gifts and charities which gratified all expectations.</div>

<div class='section-start'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1061'>1061</span><h4 class='disp-inline'>Rām Singh invites Marātha Aid.</h4>—The death of his uncle
afforded the ex-prince, Ram Singh, the chance of redeeming his
birthright; and in conjunction with the prince of Amber, he
concluded a treaty<a id='r5.13.2' /><a href='#f5.13.2' class='c013'><sup>[2]</sup></a> with the Mahrattas, the stipulations of which
were sworn to by their leaders. The “Southrons” advanced by
Kotah and Jaipur, where Ram Singh [122], with his personal
adherents and a strong auxiliary band of Amber, united their
forces, and they proceeded to the object in view, the dethronement
of Bijai Singh.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Battle of Merta.</h4>—Bijai Singh was prepared for the storm,
and led his native chivalry to the plains of Merta, where, animated
with one impulse, a determination to repel foreign interference,
they awaited the Mahrattas, to decide the rival claims to the
throne of the desert.<a id='r5.13.3' /><a href='#f5.13.3' class='c013'><sup>[3]</sup></a> The bard delights to enumerate the clans
who mustered all their strength; and makes particular allusion
to the allodial Pattawats, who were foremost on this occasion.
From Pushkar, where the combined army halted, a summons was
sent to Bijai Singh “to surrender the gaddi of Maru.” It was
read in full convention and answered with shouts of “Battle!
Battle!” “Who is this Hapa,<a id='r5.13.4' /><a href='#f5.13.4' class='c013'><sup>[4]</sup></a> thus to scare us, when, were the
firmament to fall, our heads would be pillars of support to preserve
you?” Such is the hyperbole of the Rajput when excited, nor
does his action fall far short of it. The numerical odds were
immense against the Rathors; but they little esteemed the
Kachhwahas, and their courage had very different aliment to
sustain it, from the mercenary Southron. The encounter was of
the most desperate description, and the bard deals out a full
measure of justice to all.</div>

<p class='c001'>Two accidents occurred during the battle, each sufficient to
turn victory from the standard of Bijai Singh, on the very point
of fruition. One has elsewhere been related,<a id='r5.13.5' /><a href='#f5.13.5' class='c013'><sup>[5]</sup></a> namely, the destruction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1062'>1062</span>of the “Silahposhians,” or cuirassiers, the chosen cohort of
the Rathors, when returning from a successful charge, who were
mistaken for the foe, and mowed down with discharges of grape-shot.
This error, at a moment when the courage of the Mahrattas
was wavering, might have been retrieved, notwithstanding the
superstitious converted the disaster into an omen of evil. Sindhia
had actually prepared to quit the field, when another turn of the
wheel decided the event in his favour: the circumstance exhibits
forcibly the versatile character of the Rajput.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Treachery of Sardār Singh of Kishangarh.</h4>—The Raja of
Kishangarh had deprived his relative of Rupnagar of his estates;
both were junior branches of Marwar, but held direct from the
emperor. Sawant Singh, chieftain of Rupnagar, either from
constitutional indifference or [123] old age, retired to the sanctuary
of Brindaban on the Jumna, and, before the shrine of the Hindu
Apollo, poured forth his gratitude for “his escape from hell,”
in the loss of his little kingdom. But it was in vain he attempted
to inspire young Sardar with the like contempt of mundane glory;
to his exhortations the youth replied, “It is well for you, Sire,<a id='r5.13.6' /><a href='#f5.13.6' class='c013'><sup>[6]</sup></a>
who have enjoyed life, to resign its sweets so tranquilly; but I
am yet a stranger to them.” Taking advantage of the times,
he determined to seek a stronger auxiliary for the recovery of his
rights than the poetic homilies of Jayadeva. Accordingly, he
joined the envoy of Ram Singh, and returned with the Mahratta
army, on whose successful operations his hope of reconquering his
patrimony rested. It was at that moment of doubt that Apa,
the Mahratta commander, thus addressed young Sardar: “Your
star, young man, is united to Ram Singh’s, which fortune does
not favour; what more is to be done before we move off?”
Inexperienced as he was, Sardar knew his countrymen, and their
vacillation when touched by superstition; and he obtained
permission to try a ruse, as a last resort. He dispatched a horseman
of his own clan to the division which pressed them most, who,
coming up to the Mainot minister, as if of his own party, asked
“what they were fighting for, as Bijai Singh lay dead, killed by a
cannon-shot in another part of the field?” Like the ephemeral
tribe of diplomacy, the Mainot saw his sun was set. He left the
field, followed by the panic-struck clans, amongst whom the report
circulated like wildfire. Though accustomed to these stratagems,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1063'>1063</span>with which their annals teem, the Rajputs are never on their
guard against them; not a man inquired into the truth of the
report, and Bijai Singh,—who, deeming himself in the very
career of victory, was coolly performing his devotions amidst the
clash of swords,—was left almost alone, even without attendants
or horses. The lord of Marwar, who, on that morning, commanded
the lives of one hundred thousand Rajputs, was indebted for his
safety to the mean conveyance of a cart and pair of oxen.<a id='r5.13.7' /><a href='#f5.13.7' class='c013'><sup>[7]</sup></a></div>

<p class='c001'>Every clan had to erect tablets for the loss of their best warriors;
and as in their civil wars each strove to be foremost in devotion,
most of the chieftains of note [124] were amongst the slain.<a id='r5.13.8' /><a href='#f5.13.8' class='c013'><sup>[8]</sup></a>
The bard metes out a fair measure of justice to their auxiliaries,
especially the Saktawats of Mewar, whose swords were unsheathed
in the cause of the son-in-law of their prince. Nor is the lance
of the Southron passed over without eulogy, to praise which,
indeed, is to extol themselves.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Results of Rāthor Defeat.</h4>—With the loss of this battle and the
dispersion of the Rathors, the strongholds rapidly fell. The
cause of Ram Singh was triumphing, and the Mahrattas were
spreading over the land of Maru, when foul assassination checked
their progress.<a id='r5.13.9' /><a href='#f5.13.9' class='c013'><sup>[9]</sup></a> But the death of Jai Apa, which converted
his hordes from auxiliaries to principals in the contest, called
aloud for vengeance, that was only to be appeased by the cession
of Ajmer, and a fixed triennial tribute on all the lands of Maru,
both feudal and fiscal. This arrangement being made, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1064'>1064</span>Mahrattas displayed the virtue common to such mercenary
allies: they abandoned Ram Singh to his ‘evil star,’ and took
possession of this stronghold, which, placed in the very heart of
Rajasthan, perpetuated their influence over its princes.</div>

<p class='c001'>With this gem, thus rudely torn from her diadem, the independence
of Marwar from that hour has been insecure. She has
struggled on, indeed, through a century of invasions, rebellions,
and crimes, all originating, like the blank leaf on her annals,
from the murder of Ajit. In the words of the Doric stanza of the
hostile bards on this memorable chastisement:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>Yād ghana din āvasi,</em></span></div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>“For many a day will they remember the time (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>hel</em></span>) of Apa,
when the three sovereigns fled, abandoning their goods and
treasures”: alluding to the princes of Marwar, Bikaner, and
Kishangarh, who partook in the disasters and disgrace of that day
[125].</p>

<p class='c001'>The youthful heir of Rupnagar claimed, as he justly might,
the victory to himself; and going up to Apa to congratulate him,
said, in the metaphorical language of his country, “You see I
sowed mustard-seed in my hand as I stood”: comparing the
prompt success of his stratagem to the rapid vegetation of the
seed. But Sardar was a young man of no ordinary promise;
for when Sindhia, in gratitude, offered immediately to put him in
possession of Rupnagar, he answered, “No; that would be a
retrograde movement,” and told him to act for his master Ram
Singh, “whose success would best insure his own.” But when
treachery had done its worst on Jai Apa, suspicion, which fell
on every Rajput in the Mahratta camp, spared not Sardar:
swords were drawn in every quarter, and even the messengers of
peace, the envoys, were everywhere assailed, and amongst those
who fell ere the tumult could be appeased, was Rawat Kabir
Singh, the premier noble of Mewar, then ambassador from the
Rana with the Mahrattas.<a id='r5.13.11' /><a href='#f5.13.11' class='c013'><sup>[11]</sup></a> With his last breath, Jai Apa protected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1065'>1065</span>and exonerated Sardar, and enjoined that his pledge of
restoration to his patrimony should be redeemed. The body of
this distinguished commander was burned at the Taussar, or
‘Peacock pool,’ where a cenotaph was erected, and in the care
which the descendants even of his enemies pay to it, we have a
test of the merits of both victor and vanquished.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Death of Rām Singh.</h4>—This was the last of twenty-two battles,
in which Ram Singh was prodigal of his life for the recovery of his
honours. The adversity of his later days had softened the
asperity of his temper, and made his early faults be forgotten,
though too late for his benefit. He died in exile at Jaipur in
<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1773. His person was gigantic; his demeanour affable and
courteous; and he was generous to a fault. His understanding
was excellent and well cultivated, but his capricious temperament,
to which he gave vent with an unbridled vehemence, disgusted
the high-minded nobles of Maru, and involved him in
exile and misery till his death. It is universally admitted that,
both in exterior and accomplishments, not even the great Ajit
could compare with Ram Singh, and witchcraft, at the instigation
of the chieftain of Asop, is assigned to account for his fits of insanity,
which might be better attributed to the early and immoderate
use of opium. But in spite of his errors, the fearless
courage he displayed, against all odds, kept some of the [126]
most valiant of the clans constant to his fortunes, especially the
brave Mertias, under the heroic Sher Singh of Rian, whose deeds
can never be obliterated from the recollections of the Rathor.
Not the least ardent of his adherents was the allodial chief Rup
Singh, of the almost forgotten clan, Pattawat; who held out in
Phalodi against all attempts, and who, when provisions failed, with
his noble associates, slew and ate their camels. The theme is a
favourite one for the Kamarya<a id='r5.13.12' /><a href='#f5.13.12' class='c013'><sup>[12]</sup></a> minstrel of Maru, who sings the
fidelity of Rupa and his band to the notes of his rabab,<a id='r5.13.13' /><a href='#f5.13.13' class='c013'><sup>[13]</sup></a> to their
ever attentive descendants.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Character of Rāja Rām Singh.</h4>—We may sum up the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1066'>1066</span>character of Ram Singh in the words of the bard, as he contrasts
him with his rival. “Fortune never attended the stirrup of
Bijai Singh, who never gained a battle, though at the head of a
hundred thousand men; but Ram Singh, by his valour and conduct,
gained victories with a handful.”</div>

<p class='c001'>The death of Ram Singh was no panacea to the griefs of Marwar
or of its prince. The Mahrattas, who had now obtained a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>point-d’appui</em></span>
in Rajwara, continued to foster disputes which tended
to their advantage, or when opportunity offered, to scour the
country in search of pay or plunder. Bijai Singh, young and inexperienced,
was left without resources; ruinous wars and yet
more ruinous negotiations had dissipated the hoards of wealth
accumulated by his predecessors. The crown-lands were uncultivated,
the tenantry dispersed; and commerce had diminished,
owing to insecurity and the licentious habits of the nobles, who
everywhere established their own imposts, and occasionally despoiled
entire caravans. While the competitor for the throne
was yet living, the Raja was compelled to shut his eyes on these
inroads upon his proper power, which reduced him to insignificance
even in his own palace.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Power of the Aristocracy of Mārwār.</h4>—The aristocracy in
Marwar has always possessed more power than in any of the sister
principalities around. The cause may be traced to their first
settlement in the desert; and it has been kept in action by the
peculiarities of their condition, especially in that protracted
struggle for the rights of the minor Ajit, against the despotism
of the empire. There was another cause, which, at the present
juncture, had a very unfortunate influence on the increase
of this preponderance, and which arose out of the laws of
adoption.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Pokaran Fief.</h4>—The fief of Pokaran, the most powerful
(although a junior) branch of the Champawat clan, adopted a
son of Raja Ajit as their chief; his name was Devi Singh [127].
The right of adoption, as has been already explained, rests with
the widow of the deceased and the elders of the clan. Why they
exercised it as they did on this occasion does not appear; but
not improbably at the suggestion of the dying chief, who wished
to see his sovereign’s large family provided for, having no sons
of his own: or, the immediate claimants may not have possessed
the qualities necessary to lead a clan of Maru. Although the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1067'>1067</span>moment such adoption takes place, when “the turban of the late
incumbent encircled the new lord of Pokaran,” he ought to forget
he had any other father than him he succeeded, yet we can easily
imagine that, in the present case, his propinquity to the throne,
which under other circumstances he might soon have forgotten,
was continually forced upon his recollection by the contentions of
his parricidal brothers and their offspring for the ‘cushion’ of
Marwar. It exemplifies another feature in Rajput institutions,
which cut off this son (guiltless of all participation in the treason)
from succession, because he was identified with the feudality;
while the issue of another, and junior brother, at the same period
adopted into the independent house of Idar,<a id='r5.12.14' /><a href='#f5.12.14' class='c013'><sup>[14]</sup></a> were heirs presumptive
to Marwar; nay, must supply it with a ruler on failure
of heirs, though they should have but one son and be compelled
to adopt in his room.<a id='r5.12.15' /><a href='#f5.12.15' class='c013'><sup>[15]</sup></a></div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Mercenaries enrolled.</h4>—The Champawats determined to maintain
their influence over the sovereign and the country; and
Devi Singh leagued with Awa and the other branches of this clan
to the exclusion of all competitors. They formed of their own
body a guard of honour for the person of the prince, one half
remaining on duty in the castle, the other half being in the town
below. While the Raja would lament the distracted state of his
country, the inroads of the hill tribes, and the depredations of
his own chiefs, Devi Singh of Pokaran would reply, “Why trouble
yourself about Marwar? it is in the sheath of my dagger.” The
young prince used to unburthen his griefs to his foster-brother
Jaga, a man of caution and experience, which qualities he instilled
into his sovereign. By dissimulation, and an apparent acquiescence
in their plans, he not only eluded suspicion, but, availing
himself of their natural indolence of character, at length obtained
leave not only to entertain some men of Sind as guards for the
town, but to provide supplies for their subsistence: the first
approximation towards a standing mercenary force, till then unknown
in their annals [128]. We do not mean that the Rajput
princes never employed any other than their own feudal clans;
they had foreign Rajputs in their pay, but still on the same tenure,
holding lands for service; but never till this period had they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1068'>1068</span>soldiers entertained on monthly stipend. These hired bands
were entirely composed of infantry, having a slight knowledge of
European tactics, the superiority of which, even over their high-minded
cavaliers, they had so severely experienced in their encounters
with the Mahrattas. The same causes had operated on
the courts of Udaipur and Jaipur to induce them to adopt the
like expedient; to which, more than to the universal demoralization
which followed the breaking up of the empire, may be attributed
the rapid decay of feudal principles throughout Rajputana.
These guards were composed either of Purbia<a id='r5.12.16' /><a href='#f5.12.16' class='c013'><sup>[16]</sup></a> Rajputs, Sindis,
Arabs, or Rohillas. They received their orders direct from the
prince, through the civil officers of the State, by whom they were
entrusted with the execution of all duties of importance or dispatch.
Thus they soon formed a complete barrier between the
prince and his vassals, and consequently became objects of
jealousy and of strife. In like manner did all the other States
make approaches towards a standing army; and though the
motive in all cases was the same, to curb, or even to extinguish,
the strength of the feudal chiefs, it has failed throughout, except
in the solitary instance of Kotah, where twenty well-disciplined
battalions, and a hundred pieces of artillery, are maintained
chiefly from the feudal sequestrations.</div>

<p class='c001'>To return: the Dhabhai, having thus secured a band of seven
hundred men, and obtained an aid (which we may term scutage)
from the chiefs for their maintenance, gradually transferred them
from their duties above to the gates of the castle. Somewhat
released from the thraldom of faction, the Raja concerted with
his foster-brother and the Diwan, Fateh Chand, the means of
restoring prosperity and order. So destitute was the prince of
resources, that the Dhabhai had recourse to threats of suicide
to obtain 50,000 rupees from his mother, acquired as the nurse
(<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>dhai</em></span>) of his sovereign; and so drained was the country of horses,
that he was compelled to transport his cavaliers (who were too
proud to walk) on cars to Nagor. There, under the pretence of
curbing the hill tribes, he formed an army, and dismounting the
guns from the walls of the town, marched an ill-equipped force
against the border-mountaineers, and being successful he attacked
on his return [129] the castle of Silbakri. This was deemed a
sufficient indication of his views; the whole feudality of Maru
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1069'>1069</span>took alarm, and united for mutual safety at Bisalpur, twenty
miles east of the capital.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Gordhan Singh negotiates with the Chiefs.</h4>—There was a foreign
Rajput, whose valour, fidelity, and conduct had excited the
notice and regard of Bakhta Singh, who, in his dying hour, recommended
him to the service of his son. To Gordhan, the
Khichi, a name of no small note in the subsequent history of
this reign, did the young Raja apply in order to restrain his chiefs
from revolt. In the true spirit of Rajput sentiment, he advised
his prince to confide in their honour, and, unattended, to seek
and remonstrate with them, while he went before to secure him
a good reception. At daybreak, Gordhan was in the camp of
the confederates; he told them that their prince, confiding in
their loyalty, was advancing to join them, and besought them to
march out to receive him. Deaf, however, to entreaty and to
remonstrance, not a man would stir, and the prince reached the
camp uninvited and unwelcomed. Decision and confidence are
essential in all transactions with a Rajput. Gordhan remained
not a moment in deliberation, but instantly carried his master
direct to the tent of the Awa chief, the premier noble of Marwar.
Here the whole body congregated, and silence was broken by the
prince, who demanded why his chiefs had abandoned him?</div>

<p class='c001'>“Maharaja,” replied the Champawat, “our bodies have but
one pinnacle; were there a second, it should be at your disposal.”
A tedious discussion ensued; doubts of the future, recriminations
respecting the past; till wearied and exhausted, the prince
demanded to know the conditions on which they would return
to their allegiance, when the following articles were submitted:</p>

<p class='c001'>1. To break up the force of the Dhabhai;</p>

<p class='c001'>2. To surrender to their keeping the records of fiefs (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>pattabahi</em></span>);</p>

<p class='c001'>3. That the court should be transferred from the citadel to the
town.</p>

<p class='c001'>There was no alternative but the renewal of civil strife or
compliance; and the first article, which was a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>sine qua non</em></span>, the
disbanding of the obnoxious guards, that anomalous appendage
to a Rajput prince’s person, was carried into immediate execution.
Neither in the first nor last stipulation could the prince feel
surprise or displeasure; but the second sapped the very foundation
of his rule, by depriving the crown of its dearest prerogative,
the power of dispensing favour. This shallow reconciliation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1070'>1070</span>being effected, the malcontent nobles dispersed, some to their
estates [130], and the Chondawat oligarchy to the capital with
their prince, in the hope of resuming their former influence over
him and the country.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Massacre of the Chiefs.</h4>—Thus things remained, when Atmaram,
the Guru or ‘ghostly comforter’ of Bijai Singh, fell sick, and as he
sedulously attended him, the dying priest would tell him to be of
good cheer, for when he departed, he “would take all his troubles
with him.” He soon died, and his words, which were deemed
prophetic, were interpreted by the Dhabhai. The Raja feigned
immoderate grief for the loss of his spiritual friend, and in order
to testify his veneration, an ordinance was issued commanding
that the Kiryakarma, or ‘rites for the dead,’ should be performed
in the castle, while the queens, on pretence of paying their last
duty to his remains, descended, carrying with them the guards
and retainers as their escort. It was an occasion on which suspicion,
even if awake, could not act, and the chiefs ascended to
join in the funeral rites to the saint. As they mounted the steps
cut out of the rock which wound round the hill of Jodha, the
mind of Devi Singh suddenly misgave him, and he exclaimed
that “the day was unlucky”; but it passed off with the flattering
remark, “you are the pillar of Maru; who dare even look at
you?” They paced slowly through the various barriers, until
they reached the Alarum Gate.<a id='r5.12.17' /><a href='#f5.12.17' class='c013'><sup>[17]</sup></a> It was shut! “Treachery!”
exclaimed the chief of Awa, as he drew his sword, and the work
of death commenced. Several were slain; the rest were overpowered.
Their captivity was a sufficient presage of their fate;
but, like true Rajputs, when the Dhabhai told them they were
to die, their last request was, “that their souls might be set at
liberty by the sword, not by the unsanctified ball of the mercenary.”
The chronicle does not say whether this wish was
gratified, when the three great leaders of the Champawats, with
Jeth Singh of Awa; Devi Singh of Pokaran; the lord of Harsola;
Chhattar Singh, chief of the Kumpawats; Kesari Singh of
Chandren; the heir of Nimaj; and the chief of Ras,<a id='r5.12.18' /><a href='#f5.12.18' class='c013'><sup>[18]</sup></a> then the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1071'>1071</span>principal fief of the Udawats, met their fate. The last hour of
Devi Singh was marked with a distinguished peculiarity. Being
of the royal line of Maru, they would not spill his blood, but sent
him his death-warrant in a jar of opium. On receiving it, and
his prince’s command to make his own departure from life,
“What!” said the noble spirit, as they presented the jar, “shall
Devi [131] Singh take his <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>amal</em></span> (opiate) out of an earthen vessel?
Let his gold cup be brought, and it shall be welcome.” This
last vain distinction being denied, he dashed out his brains against
the walls of his prison. Before he thus enfranchised his proud
spirit, some ungenerous mind, repeating his own vaunt, demanded,
“where was then the sheath of the dagger which held the fortunes
of Marwar?” “In Subhala’s girdle at Pokaran,” was the
laconic reply of the undaunted Chondawat.</div>

<p class='c001'>This was a tremendous sacrifice for the maintenance of
authority, of men who had often emptied their veins in defence
of their country. But even ultra patriotism, when opposed to
foreign aggression, can prove no palliative to treason or mitigate
its award, when, availing themselves of the diminished power of
the prince, an arrogant and imperious oligarchy presumes to
enthral their sovereign. It is the mode in which vengeance
was executed at which the mind recoils, and which with other
instances appears to justify the imputation of perfidy amongst
the traits of Rajput character. But if we look deeply into it,
we shall find reason to distrust such conclusion. The Rajput
abhors, in the abstract, both perfidy and treason; but the elements
of the society in which he lives and acts, unfortunately too often
prompt the necessity of sacrificing principles to preservation: but
this proceeds from their faulty political constitution; it is neither
inculcated in their moral code, nor congenial to their moral habits.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Right of Primogeniture.</h4>—The perpetual struggle between the
aristocracy and the sovereign, which is an evil inherent in all
feudal associations, was greatly aggravated in Marwar, as well
as in Mewar, by the sacrifice of that corner-stone even of constitutional
monarchy, the rights of primogeniture. But in each
case the deviation from custom was a voluntary sacrifice of the
respective heirs-apparent to the caprices of parental dotage. In
no other country in the world could that article of the Christian
decalogue, “Honour thy father and thy mother,” be better
illustrated than in Rajputana, where, if we have had to record
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1072'>1072</span>two horrid examples of deviation from, we have also exhibited
splendid proofs of, filial devotion, in Chonda of Mewar, and
Champa of Marwar, who resigned the “rods” they were born to
wield; and served, when they should have swayed, to gratify
their father’s love for the fruit of their old age. These are instances
of self-denial hardly to be credited; from such disinterested
acts, their successors claimed an importance which, though
natural, was totally unforeseen, and which the extent of compensation
contributed [132] to foster. They asserted the right,
as hereditary premiers of the State, to be the advisers, or rather
the tutors, of their sovereigns, more especially in non-age, and in
allusion to this surrender of their birthright, arrogantly applied the
well-known adage, <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>Pat ka malik main ho, Raj ka malik uha</em></span>, ‘He
is sovereign of the State, but I am the master of the Throne’;
and insisted on the privilege of being consulted on every gift of
land, and putting their autograph symbol to the deed or grant.<a id='r5.12.19' /><a href='#f5.12.19' class='c013'><sup>[19]</sup></a>
These pretensions demanded the constant exertions of the sovereign
to resist them; for this purpose, he excited the rivalry of the less
powerful members of the federated vassalage, and thus formed
a kind of balance of power, which the monarch, if skilful, could
always turn to account. But not even the jealousies thus introduced
would have so depreciated the regal influence in Marwar,
nor even the more recent adoption of a son of the crown into the
powerful fief of Pokaran, had not the parricidal sons of Ajit
degraded the throne in the eyes of their haughty and always
overreaching vassals, who, in the civil strife which followed,
were alternately in favour or disgrace, as they adhered to or
opposed the successful claimant for power. To this foul blot,
every evil which has since overtaken this high-minded race may
be traced, as well as the extirpation of that principle of devoted
obedience which, in the anterior portion of these annals, has been
so signally recorded. To this hour it has perpetuated dissensions
between the crown and the oligarchy, leading to deposal and
violence to the princes, or sequestration, banishment, and death
to the nobles. To break the bonds of this tutelage, Ram Singh’s
intemperance lost him the crown, which sat uneasy on the head of
his successor, who had no other mode of escape but by the severity
which has been related. But though it freed him for a time, the
words of the dying chief of Pokaran continued to ring in his ears;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1073'>1073</span>and “the dagger left in the girdle of his son” disturbed the
dreams of his rest throughout a long life of vicissitudes, poisoning
the source of enjoyment until death itself was a relief.</div>

<p class='c001'>The nuncupatory testament of the Champawat was transmitted
across the desert to his son at Pokaran, and the rapidity
of its transmission was only equalled by the alacrity of Sabhala,
who at the head of his vassals issued forth to execute the vengeance
thus bequeathed. First, he attempted to burn and pillage
the mercantile town of Pali; foiled in which, he proceeded to
another wealthy city of the fisc [133], Bhilwara on the Luni;
but here terminated both his life and his revenge. As he led the
escalade, he received two balls, which hurled him back amongst
his kinsmen, and his ashes next morning blanched the sandy bed
of the Luni.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Suppression of Aristocratic Influence.</h4>—For a time the feudal
interest was restrained, anarchy was allayed, commerce again
flourished, and general prosperity revived: to use the words of
the chronicle, “the subject enjoyed tranquillity, and the tiger
and the lamb drank from the same fountain.” Bijai Singh took
the best means to secure the fidelity of his chiefs, by finding them
occupation. He carried his arms against the desultory hordes of
the desert, the Khosas and Sahariyas, which involved him in
contests with the nominal sovereign of Sind, and ended in the
conquest of Umarkot, the key to the valley of the Indus, and
which is now the most remote possession of Marwar. He also
curtailed the territories of Jaisalmer, on his north-west frontier.
But more important than all was the addition of the rich province
of Godwar, from the Rana of Mewar. This tract, which nearly
equals in value the whole fiscal domain of Maru, was wrested
from the ancient princes of Mandor, prior to the Rathors, and
had been in the possession of the Sesodias for nearly five centuries,
when civil dissension made the Rana place it for security under
the protection of Raja Bijai Singh; since which it has been lost
to Mewar.</div>

September 1790.</h4>—Marwar had enjoyed several years of peace,
when the rapid strides made by the Mahrattas towards universal
rapine, if not conquest, compelled the Rajputs once more to form
an union for the defence of their political existence. Partap
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1074'>1074</span>Singh, a prince of energy and enterprise, was now on the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>gaddi</em></span>
of Amber. In S. 1843 (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1787), he sent an ambassador to
Bijai Singh, proposing a league against the common foe, and
volunteering to lead in person their conjoined forces against
them. The battle of Tonga ensued, in which Rathor valour
shone forth in all its glory. Despising discipline, they charged
through the dense battalions of De Boigne, sabring his artillerymen
at their guns, and compelling Sindhia to abandon not only
the field, but all his conquests for a time.<a id='r5.12.20' /><a href='#f5.12.20' class='c013'><sup>[20]</sup></a> Bijai Singh, by this
victory, redeemed the castle of Ajmer, and declared his tributary
alliance null and void. But the genius of Sindhia, and the
talents of De Boigne, soon recovered this loss; and in four years
the Mahratta marched with a force such as Indian warfare was
stranger to, to redeem that day’s disgrace. In S. 1847 (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span>
1791), the murderous [134] battles of Patan and Merta took
place, in which Rajput courage was heroically but fruitlessly
displayed against European tactics and unlimited resources, and
where neither intrigue nor treason was wanting. The result
was the imposition of a contribution of sixty lakhs of rupees, or
£600,000; and as so much could not be drained from the country,
goods and chattels were everywhere distrained, and hostages
given for the balance.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Ajmer lost to Mārwār.</h4>—Ajmer, which had revolted on the
short-lived triumph of Tonga, was once more surrendered, and
lost for ever to Marwar. When invested by De Boigne, the
faithful governor, Damraj, placed in the dilemma of a disgraceful
surrender, or disobedience to his prince’s summons, swallowed
diamond-powder.<a id='r5.12.21' /><a href='#f5.12.21' class='c013'><sup>[21]</sup></a> “Tell the raja,” said this faithful servant,
“thus only could I testify my obedience; and over my dead
body alone could a Southron enter Ajmer.”<a id='r5.12.22' /><a href='#f5.12.22' class='c013'><sup>[22]</sup></a></div>

<div class='section-start'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1075'>1075</span><h4 class='disp-inline'>Influence of Court Morals.</h4>—The paramount influence which
the morals and manners of a court exert upon a nation, is everywhere
admitted. In constitutional governments, there is a
barrier even to court influence and corruption, in the vast portion
of wealth and worth which cannot be engulphed in their vortex.
But in these petty sovereignties no such check is found, and the
tone of virtue and action is given from the throne. The laws
of semi-barbarous nations, which admit of licentious concubinage,
have ever been peculiar to orientals, from the days of the wise
king of the Jews to those of Bijai Singh of Marwar; and their
political consequence has been the same, the sacrifice of the rights
of lawful inheritance to the heirs of illicit affection. The last
years of the king of Maru were engrossed by sentimental folly
with a young beauty of the Oswal tribe, on whom he lavished all
the honours due only to his legitimate queens. Scandal affirms
that she frequently returned his passion in a manner little becoming
royal dignity, driving him from her presence with the basest of
missiles—her shoes. As the effects of this unworthy attachment
completed the anarchy of Marwar, and as its consequences on
deviating from the established rules of succession have entailed
a perpetuity of crime and civil war, under which this unfortunate
State yet writhes, we shall be minute, even to dullness, in the
elucidation [135] of this portion of their annals, to enable those
who have now to arbitrate these differences to bring back a current
of uncontaminated blood to sway the destinies of this still noble
race.</div>

Bijai Singh with the Pasbani<a id='r5.12.23' /><a href='#f5.12.23' class='c013'><sup>[23]</sup></a> concubine, that on losing the only
pledge of their amours, he ‘put into her lap’ (adopted) his own
legitimate grandchild, Man Singh. To legalize this adoption,
the chieftains were ordained to present their <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>nazars</em></span> and congratulations
to the declared heir of Marwar; but the haughty
noblesse refused ‘to acknowledge the son of a slave’ as their
lord, and the Raja was compelled to a fresh adoption to ensure
such token of sanction. Content at having by this method
succeeded in her wishes, the Pasbani sent off young Man to the
castle of Jalor; but fearing lest the experience of Sher Singh, his
adopted father, might prove a hindrance to her control, he was
recalled, and her own creatures left to guide the future sovereign
of Marwar. The dotage of Bijai Singh, and the insolence of his
concubine, produced fresh discord, and the clans assembled at
Malkosni<a id='r5.12.24' /><a href='#f5.12.24' class='c013'><sup>[24]</sup></a> to concert his deposal.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Rebellion of the Clansmen against Bijai Sīngh.</h4>—Recollecting
the success of his former measures to recall them to their duty,
Bijai Singh proceeded to their camp; but while he was negotiating,
and as he supposed successfully, the confederates wrote to
the chieftain of Ras, whose tour of duty was in the castle, to
descend with Bhim Singh. The chief acquainted the Pasbani
that her presence was required at the camp by the Raja, and that
a guard of honour was ready to attend her. She was thrown off
her guard, and at the moment she entered her litter, a blow from
an unseen hand ended her existence. Her effects were instantly
confiscated, and the chief of Ras descended with Bhim, whose
tents were pitched at the Nagor barrier of the city. If, instead
of encamping there, they had proceeded to the camp of the confederates,
his arrival and the dethronement of Bijai Singh would
have been simultaneous: but the Raja received the intelligence
as soon as the chiefs. Hastening back, he obtained the person of
the young aspirant, to whom, to reconcile him to his disappointment,
he gave in appanage the districts of Sojat and Siwana, and
sent him off to the latter stronghold; while to restrain the resentment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1077'>1077</span>of his eldest son, Zalim Singh, whose birthright he had so
unworthily sacrificed, he enfeoffed him with the rich district of
Godwar, giving him private orders to attack his brother Bhim,
who, though apprised of the design in time to make head against
his uncle, was yet defeated and compelled to fly. He found
refuge at Pokaran, whence he went to Jaisalmer.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Death of Rāja Bijai Singh.</h4>—In the midst of this conflict, his
dominions curtailed, his chiefs in rebellion, his sons and grandsons
mutually opposed to each other, and the only object which
attached him to life thus violently torn from him, Bijai Singh
died, in the month Asarh S. 1850, after a reign of thirty-one
years [136].</div>

<h3 class='c024'>CHAPTER 14</h3>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Rāja Bhīm Singh, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1793-1803.</h4>—The intelligence of Bijai
Singh’s death was conveyed by express to his grandson Bhim, at
Jaisalmer. In “twenty-two hours” he was at Jodhpur, and
ascending directly to the citadel, seated himself upon the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>gaddi</em></span>,
while his rival, Zalim Singh, the rightful heir, little expecting this
celerity, was encamped at the Merta gate, awaiting the “lucky
hour” to take possession. That hour never arrived; and the
first intelligence of Bhim being on “the cushion of Jodha,” was
conveyed to the inhabitants by the nakkaras of his rival on his
retreat from the city, who was pursued to Bhilara, attacked,
defeated, and forced to seek shelter at Udaipur, where, with an
ample domain from the Rana, he passed the rest of his days in
literary pursuits. He died in the prime of life: attempting to
open a vein with his own hand, he cut an artery and bled to death.
He was a man of great personal and mental qualifications; a
gallant soldier, and no mean poet.<a id='r5.14.1' /><a href='#f5.14.1' class='c013'><sup>[1]</sup></a> [137]</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Rāja Bhīm disposes of his Rivals.</h4>—Thus far successful, Raja
Bhim determined to dismiss “compunctious visitings,” and be a
king <span lang="l" xml:lang="l"><em>de facto</em></span> if not <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>de jure</em></span>. Death had carried off three of his
uncles, as well as his father, previous to this event; but there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1078'>1078</span>were still two others, Sher Singh, his adopted father, and Sardar
Singh, who stood in his way: the last was put to death; the
former had his eyes put out; and, soon after, the unfortunate
prince released himself from life by dashing out his brains. Sur
Singh, the favourite of all Bijai Singh’s descendants, remained.
His superior claims were fatal to him and his life fell a sacrifice
with the others.</div>

<p class='c001'>A single claimant alone remained of all the blood royal of
Maru to disturb the repose of Bhim. This was young Man, the
adopted son of the concubine, placed beyond his reach within the
walls of Jalor. Could Bhim’s dagger have reached him, he would
have stood alone, the last surviving scion of the parricide,</p>

<p class='c015'>an instrument, in the hand of divine power, to rid the land of an
accursed stock. Then the issue of Abhai Singh would have
utterly perished, and their ashes might have been given to the
winds, and no memorial of them left. Idar must then have
supplied an heir,<a id='r5.14.2' /><a href='#f5.14.2' class='c013'><sup>[2]</sup></a> and the doubtful pretensions of Dhonkal,<a id='r5.14.3' /><a href='#f5.14.3' class='c013'><sup>[3]</sup></a> the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1079'>1079</span>posthumous and reputed son of the wholesale assassin Bhim, to
sit upon the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>gaddi</em></span> of Ajit, would never have been brought forward
to excite another murderous contest amongst the sons of Jodha.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Escape of Mān Singh.</h4>—Having sacrificed all those within his
reach who stood between him and the [139] throne, Bhim tried
to secure the last sole claimant in Jalor. But the siege of such a
stronghold with his feudal levies, or loose mercenary bands, was
a tedious operation, and soon became an imperfect blockade,
through which young Man not unfrequently broke, and by signal
formed a junction with his adherents, and plundered the fiscal
lands for support. One of these excursions, however, an attempt
to plunder Pali, had nearly proved fatal to him; they were
attacked on their return, and young Man, whose secluded education
had confined him more to mental than to personal accomplishments,
was unhorsed, and would have been captured, but for the
prowess of the chief of Ahor, who took him up behind him and
bore him off in safety. Nothing but the turbulence of the chiefs
who supported Raja Bhim saved young Man’s life. A disputed
succession has always produced an odious faction; and Bhim,
who was not disposed to bend to this oligarchy, appears to have
had all the imprudence of the dethroned Ram Singh: he threatened
those entrusted with the siege to give them “oxen to ride instead
of horses.” The chiefs fired at the insult, and retired to Ghanerao,
the principal fief in Godwar; but, disgusted with both parties,
instead of obeying the invitation of young Man, they abandoned
their country altogether, and sought an asylum in the neighbouring
States. Many fiefs were sequestrated, and Nimaj, the chief
seat of the Udawats, was attacked, and after a twelve months’
defence, taken; its battlements were ignominiously destroyed,
and the victors, chiefly foreign mercenaries, reinforced the
blockade of Jalor.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Siege of Jālor. Death of Rāja Bhīm Singh.</h4>—With the exile
of his partisans and daily diminishing resources, when the lower
town was taken, there appeared no hope for young Man. A
small supply of millet-flour was all the provision left to his half-famished
garrison, whose surrender was now calculated upon,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1080'>1080</span>when an invitation came from the hostile commander for Man
to repair to his camp, and adding “he was now the master; it
was his duty to serve.” On that day (the 2nd Kartik S. 1860,
Dec. 1804), after eleven years of defence, his means exhausted,
his friends banished, and death from starvation or the sword inevitable,
intelligence came of Raja Bhim’s demise! This event,
as unlooked-for as it was welcome, could scarcely at first be
credited; and the tender of the homage of the commander to
Man as his sovereign, though accompanied by a letter from the
prime minister Induraj, was disregarded till the Guru Deonath
returned from the camp with confirmation of the happy news,
that “not a moustache [140] was to be seen in the camp.”<a id='r5.14.4' /><a href='#f5.14.4' class='c013'><sup>[4]</sup></a>
Thither the prince repaired, and was hailed as the head of the
Rathors.</div>

<p class='c001'>It is said that the successor of the Guru Atmaram, “who
carried all the troubles of Bijai Singh with him to heaven,” had
predicted of young Man Singh, when at the very zero of adversity,
that “his fortunes would ascend.” What were the means whereby
the ghostly comforter of Raja Bhim influenced his political
barometer, we know not; but prophetic Gurus, bards, astrologers,
physicians, and all the Vaidyas or ‘cunning-men,’<a id='r5.14.5' /><a href='#f5.14.5' class='c013'><sup>[5]</sup></a> who beset
the persons of princes, prove dangerous companions when, in
addition to the office of compounders of drugs and expounders of
dreams, they are invested with the power of realizing their own
prognostications.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Rāja Mān Singh, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1803-43.</h4>—On the 5th of Margsir, 1860
(<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1804), Raja Man, released from his perils, succeeded to the
honours and the feuds of Bijai Singh. He had occupied the
‘cushion of Maru’ but a very short period, when the Pokaran
chief “took offence,” and put himself in hostility to his sovereign.
The name of this proud vassal, the first in power though only of
secondary rank amongst the Champawats, was Sawai Singh, with
whom now remained “the sheath of the dagger which held the
fortunes of Maru.” If the fulfilment of vengeance be a virtue,
Sawai was the most virtuous son on earth. The dagger of Devi
Singh, bequeathed to Sabhala, was no imaginary weapon in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1081'>1081</span>hands of his grandson Sawai, who held it suspended over the head
of Raja Man from his enthronement to his death-hour. Soon
after Raja Man’s accession, Sawai retired with his partisans to
Chopasni, a spot about five miles from the capital, where the conspiracy
was prepared. He told the chiefs that the wife of Raja
Bhim was pregnant, and prevailed on them to sign a declaration,
that if a son was born, he should be installed on the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>gaddi</em></span> of
Jodha. They returned in a body to the capital, took the pregnant
queen from the castle, and placed her in a palace in the city, under
their own protection. Moreover, they held a council, at which
the Raja was present, who agreed to recognise the infant, if a
male, as the heir-apparent of Maru, and to enfeoff him in the
appanage of Nagor and Siwana; and that if a female, she should
be betrothed to a prince of Dhundhar [141].</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Dangers from Posthumous Births.</h4>—Posthumous births are
never-failing germs of discord in these States; and the issue is
inevitably branded by one party with the title of ‘supposititious.’
It is likewise a common saying, almost amounting to a proverb,
that a male child is the uniform result of such a position. In
due course, a male infant was born; but, alarmed for its safety,
the mother concealed both its birth and sex, and placing it in a
basket, conveyed it by a faithful servant from the city, whence it
soon reached Sawai Singh at Pokaran. He bestowed upon it the
inauspicious name of Dhonkal, that is, one born to tumult and
strife. It is said that during two years he kept the birth a
profound secret, and it is even added, that it might have remained
so, had Raja Man forgot the history of the past, and dispensed
even-handed justice. Wanting, however, the magnanimity of
the Fourth Henry of France, who scorned “to revenge the wrongs
of the prince of Navarre,” he reserved his favours and confidence
for those who supported him in Jalor, whilst he evinced his dislike
to others who, in obedience to their sovereign, served against him.
Of these adherents, only two chiefs of note were of his kin and
clan; the others were Bhatti Rajputs, and a body of those
religious militants called Bishanswamis, under their Mahant,
or leader, Kaimdas.<a id='r5.14.6' /><a href='#f5.14.6' class='c013'><sup>[6]</sup></a></div>

<div class='section-start'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1082'>1082</span><h4 class='disp-inline'>Sawāi Singh supports Dhonkal Singh.</h4>—At the expiration
of two years, Sawai communicated the event to the chiefs of his
party, who called upon Raja Man to redeem his promise and
issue the grant for Nagor and Siwana. He promised compliance
if, upon investigation, the infant proved to be the legitimate
offspring of his predecessor. Personal fear overcame maternal
affection, and the queen, who remained at Jodhpur, disclaimed
the child. Her reply being communicated to the chiefs, it was for
a time conclusive, and the subject ceased to interest them, the
more especially as her concealed accouchement had never been
properly accounted for.</div>

<p class='c001'>Though Sawai, with his party, apparently acquiesced, his
determination was taken; but instead of an immediate appeal to
arms, he adopted a deeper scheme of policy, the effects of which
he could not have contemplated, and which involved his own
destruction, and with it the independence of his country, which
was transferred to [142] strangers, their very antipodes in manners,
religion, and every moral quality. His first act was to procure
a more powerful protection than Pokaran afforded; and under
the guarantee of Chhattar Singh Bhatti, he was sent to the saran
(sanctuary) of Abhai Singh of Khetri.<a id='r5.14.7' /><a href='#f5.14.7' class='c013'><sup>[7]</sup></a> Having so far succeeded,
he contrived an underplot, in which his genius for intrigue appears
not below his reputation as a soldier.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Krishna Kunwāri.</h4>—The late prince Bhim had made overtures
to the Rana of Mewar for the hand of his daughter, but he died
before the preliminaries were adjusted. This simple circumstance
was deemed sufficient by the Champawat for the groundwork
of his plot. He contrived to induce the voluptuous Jagat
Singh, the prince of Jaipur, to put himself in the place of Raja
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1083'>1083</span>Bhim, and to propose for the fair hand of Krishna. This being
accomplished, and nuptial presents, under a guard of four
thousand men, being dispatched to Udaipur, Sawai intimated to
Raja Man that he would be eternally disgraced if he allowed the
prince of Amber to carry off “the betrothed”; that “it was to
the throne of Maru, not its occupant, she was promised.” The
bait was greedily swallowed, and the summons for the Kher (or
levy <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>en masse</em></span>) of the Rathors was immediately proclaimed. Man
instantly assembled three thousand horse, and joining to them
the mercenary bands of Hira Singh then on the frontier of Mewar,
he intercepted the nuptial gifts of Amber. Indignant at this
outrage, Jagat Singh took to arms, and the muster-book was
declared open to all who would serve in the war which was formally
declared against Maru.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Attack by Rāja Jagat Singh of Jaipur on Mārwār. Treachery
of Jaswant Rāo Holkar.</h4>—Having thus opened the drama, Sawai
threw off the mask, and repaired to Khetri, whence he conveyed
the pretender, Dhonkal, to the court of Jagat Singh at Jaipur.
Here his legitimacy was established by being admitted ‘to eat
from the same platter’ with its prince; and his claims, as the
heir of Marwar, were publicly acknowledged and advocated, by
his ‘placing him in the lap of his aunt,’<a id='r5.14.8' /><a href='#f5.14.8' class='c013'><sup>[8]</sup></a> one of the wives of the
deceased Raja Bhim. His cause thus espoused, and being
declared the nephew of Amber, the nobles of Marwar, who deemed
the claims of the pretender superior to those of Raja Man, speedily
collected around his standard. Amongst these was the prince
of Bikaner, whose example (he being the most powerful of the
independents of this house) at once sanctioned the justice of
Dhonkal’s cause, and left that of Raja Man almost without
support. Nevertheless, with the hereditary [143] valour of his
race, he advanced to the frontiers to meet his foes, whose numbers,
led by the Jaipur prince and the pretender, exceeded one hundred
thousand men! This contest, the ostensible object of which
was the princess of Mewar, like the crusades of ancient chivalry,
brought allies from the most remote parts of India. Even the
cautious Mahratta felt an unusual impulse in this rivalry, beyond
the stimulants of pay and plunder which ordinarily rouse him,
and corps after corps left their hordes to support either cause.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1084'>1084</span>The weightier purse of Jaipur was the best argument for the
justice of his cause and that of the pretender; while Raja Man
had only the gratitude of Holkar to reckon upon for aid, to whose
wife and family he had given sanctuary when pursued by Lord
Lake to the Attock. But here Sawai again foiled him; and the
Mahratta, then only eighteen miles from Man, and who had
promised to join him next day, made a sudden movement to
the south. A bribe of £100,000, in bills upon Kotah, to be paid
on Holkar’s reaching that city, effected this desertion; which
being secured, Jagat Singh and the pretender advanced to overwhelm
their antagonist, who was posted at Gingoli. As the
armies approached each other, Raja Man’s chiefs rode up to
salute him, preparatory, as he thought, to head their clans for
the combat; but it was their farewell obeisance. The cannonade
opened, they rallied under the standard of the pretender, and on
Sawai advancing on the right of the allied line, so entire was the
defection, that even the Mertia clan, whose virtue and boast it is
“to adhere to the throne, whoever is the occupant,” deserted,
with the Champawats, Jethawats, and minor chiefs. Four
chieftains alone abided the evil hour of Raja Man, namely, Kuchaman,
Ahor, Jalor, and Nimaj; and with their quotas alone, and
the auxiliary bands of Bundi, he would have rushed into the
battle. Hindered from this, he attempted his own life: but the
design was frustrated by Sheonath of Kuchaman, who dismounted
him from his elephant, and advised his trusting to the fleetness
of his steed, while they covered his flight. The Raja remarked,
he was the first of his race who ever disgraced the name of Rathor
by showing his back to a Kachhwaha. The position he had
taken that morning was favourable to retreat, being a mile in
advance of the pass of Parbatsar:<a id='r5.14.9' /><a href='#f5.14.9' class='c013'><sup>[9]</sup></a> this was speedily gained, and
nobly defended by the battalions of Bundi, and those of Hindal
Khan, in the pay of Raja Man, which retarded the pursuit,
headed by the Rao of Uniara. Raja Man reached Merta in safety;
but deeming it incapable of long [144] resistance, he continued
his flight by Pipar to the capital, which he reached with a slender
retinue, including the four chiefs, who still shared his fortunes.
The camp of Raja Man was pillaged. Eighteen guns were taken
by Bala Rao Inglia, one of Sindhia’s commanders, and the lighter
effects, the tents, elephants, and baggage, were captured by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1085'>1085</span>Amir Khan; while Parbatsar, and the villages in the neighbourhood,
were plundered.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Rāja Mān Singh defends Jodhpur.</h4>—Thus far, the scheme of
Sawai and the pretender advanced with rapid success. When the
allied army reached Merta, the prince of Jaipur, whose object
was the princess of Mewar, proposed to Sawai to follow up their
good fortune, while he repaired to Udaipur, and solemnized the
nuptials. But even in the midst of his revenge, Sawai could
distinguish “between the cause of Man Singh and the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>gaddi</em></span> of
Marwar”; and to promote the success of Jaipur, though he had
originated the scheme to serve his own views, was no part of his
plan. He was only helped out of this dilemma by another, which
he could not anticipate. Not dreaming that Raja Man would
hold out in the capital, which had no means of defence, but
supposing he would fly to Jalor, and leave Jodhpur to its fate and
to the pretender, Sawai, desirous to avoid the further advance of
the allies into the country, halted the army for three days at
Merta. His foresight was correct: the Raja had reached
Bisalpur in full flight to Jalor, when, at the suggestion of Gyanmall
Singhi, a civil officer in his train, he changed his intention.
“There,” said the Singhi, “lies Jodhpur only nine coss to the
right, while Jalor is sixteen further; it is as easy to gain the one
as the other, and if you cannot hold out in the capital, what
chance have you elsewhere? while you defend your throne your
cause is not lost.” Raja Man followed the advice, reached
Jodhpur in a few hours, and prepared for his defence. This unexpected
change, and the halt of the allied army, which permitted
the dispersed bands to gain the capital, defeated the schemes
of Sawai.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Siege of Jodhpur.</h4>—With a body of three thousand men,
selected from Hindal Khan’s brigade, the corps of Bishanswamis,
under Kaimdas, and one thousand foreign Rajputs, consisting of
Chauhans, Bhattis, and Indhas (the ancient lords of Mandor),
Raja Man formed a garrison of five thousand men, on whom he
could depend. So ample did he deem this number, that he
dispatched strong garrisons from Hindal’s brigade, with some
Deora Rajputs, to garrison Jalor, and preserve the distant castle
of Umarkot from surprise by the Sindis. Having thus provided
against the storm [145] he fearlessly awaited the result. But
so alienated was his mind from his kindred, that he would not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1086'>1086</span>even admit to the honour of defending his throne the four faithful
chieftains who, in the general desertion, had abided by his fortunes.
To all their entreaties to be received into the castle, that “they
might defend the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>kunguras</em></span> (battlements) of Jodha,” he replied,
they might defend the city if they pleased; and disgusted with
such a return for their fidelity, they increased the train of his
opponents, who soon encompassed Jodhpur.</div>

<p class='c001'>The town, little capable of defence, was taken and given up to
unlicensed plunder; and with the exception of Phalodi, which
was gallantly defended for three months, and given to Bikaner
as the reward of its alliance, the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>an</em></span> of the pretender was proclaimed
throughout Marwar, and his allies only awaited the fall of the
capital, which appeared inevitable, to proclaim him king. But a
circumstance occurred, which, awakening the patriotism of the
Rathors, thwarted these fair prospects, relieved Raja Man from
his peril, and involved his adversaries in the net of destruction
which they had woven for him.</p>

<p class='c001'>The siege had lasted five months without any diminution of
the ardour of the defenders; and although the defences of the
north-east angle were destroyed, the besiegers, having a perpendicular
rock of eighty feet to ascend before they could get to
the breach, were not nearer their object, and, in fact, without
shells, the castle of Jodha would laugh a siege to scorn. The
numerous and motley force under the banners of Jaipur and the
pretender, became clamorous for pay; the forage was exhausted,
and the partisan horse were obliged to bivouac in the distant
districts to the south. Availing himself of their separation from
the main body, Amir Khan, an apt pupil of the Mahratta school,
began to raise contributions on the fiscal lands, and Pali, Pipar,
Bhilara, with many others, were compelled to accede to his
demands. The estates of the nobles who espoused the cause of
the pretender, fared no better, and they complained to the Xerxes
of this host of the conduct of this unprincipled commander.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Amir Khān supports Mān Singh. Defeat of the Jaipur Army
<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1806.</h4>—The protracted defence having emptied the treasury
of Amber, the arch-intriguer of Pokaran was called upon to contribute
towards satisfying the clamour of the troops. Having
exhausted the means of his own party, he applied to the four
chieftains who had been induced to join the cause of the pretender
by the suspicions of Raja Man, to advance a sum of money.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1087'>1087</span>This appeal proved a test of [146] their zeal. They abandoned
the pretender, and proceeded direct to the camp of Amir Khan.
It required no powerful rhetoric to detach him from the cause and
prevail upon him to advocate that of Raja Man; nor could they
have given him better counsel towards this end, than the proposal
to carry the war into the enemy’s country: to attack and plunder
Jaipur, now left unguarded. At this critical moment, the Jaipur
prince, in consequence of the representation of the Marwar chiefs,
had directed his commander-in-chief, Sheolal, to chastise Amir
Khan for his lawless conduct. Sheolal put a stop to their deliberations,
attacked and drove them across the Luni, surprised them
at Govindgarh, again in a night attack at Harsuri, and pursued
the Khan to Phaggi,<a id='r5.14.10' /><a href='#f5.14.10' class='c013'><sup>[10]</sup></a> at the very frontier of Jaipur. Astonished
at his own success, and little aware that the chase was in the
direction projected by his enemy, Sheolal deemed he had accomplished
his orders in driving him out of Marwar; halted, and
leaving his camp, repaired to Jaipur to partake of its festivities.
The Khan, who with his allies had reached Pipla near Tonk, no
sooner heard of this, than he called to his aid the heavy brigades
of Muhammad Shah Khan and Raja Bahadur (then besieging
Isarda<a id='r5.14.11' /><a href='#f5.14.11' class='c013'><sup>[11]</sup></a>), and availed himself of the imprudent absence of his foe
to gain over the Haidarabad Rasala, a legion well known in the
predatory wars of that period. Having effected this object, he
assailed the Jaipur force, which, notwithstanding this defection
and the absence of its commander, fought with great valour, the
battalions of Hira Singh being nearly cut to pieces. The action
ended in the entire defeat of the Jaipurians, and the capture of
their camp, guns, and equipage. Prompted by the Rathor
chieftains, whose valour led to this result, Amir Khan rapidly
followed up his success, and Jaipur was dismayed by the presence
of the victor at her gates. The generalship of the Khan was the
salvation of Raja Man; it dissolved the confederacy, and fixed
the doom of Sawai, its projector.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Confederacy against Jodhpur dissolved.</h4>—The tempest had
been some time gathering; the Rajas of Bikaner and Shahpura
had already withdrawn from the confederacy and marched home,
when, like a clap of thunder, the effeminate Kachhwaha, who had
in the outset of this crusade looked to a full harvest both of glory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1088'>1088</span>and of love, learned that his army was annihilated, and his capital
invested by the Khan and a handful of Rathors. Duped by the
representations of Sawai, Rae Chand, Diwan or prime minister
of Jaipur, concealed for some days these disasters from his
sovereign, who received the intelligence by a special messenger
sent by the queen-mother. Enraged, perplexed, and alarmed
[147] for his personal safety, he broke up the siege, and sending
on in advance the spoils of Jodhpur (including forty pieces of
cannon), with his own chieftains, he sent for the Mahratta leaders,<a id='r5.14.12' /><a href='#f5.14.12' class='c013'><sup>[12]</sup></a>
and offered them £120,000 to escort him in safety to his capital;
nay, he secretly bribed, with a bond of £90,000 more, the author
of his disgrace, Amir Khan, not to intercept his retreat, which
was signally ignominious, burning his tents and equipage at
every stage, and at length with his own hand destroying his
favourite elephant, which wanted “speed for the rapidity of his
flight.”</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Jodhpur Booty recovered.</h4>—But the indignities he had to suffer
were not over. The chieftains whose sagacity and valour had
thus diverted the storm from Raja Man, determined that no
trophies of Rathor disgrace should enter Jaipur, united their
clans about twenty miles east of Merta, on the line of retreat,
appointing Induraj Singhi their leader. This person, who had
held the office of Diwan under two predecessors of Raja Man,
was driven to a temporary defection from the same suspicions
which made the chiefs join the pretender. But they resolved to
wash away the stain of this brief alienation from Raja Man with
the blood of his enemies, and to present as a token of returning
fidelity the recaptured trophies. The encounter took place on
the joint frontier. It was short, but furious; and the Kachhwahas,
who could not withstand the Rathors, were defeated and
dispersed, and the spoils of the spoiler, including the forty cannon,
were safely lodged in Kuchaman. Flushed with success, the
victors addressed the Raja of Kishangarh, who, though a Rathor,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1089'>1089</span>had kept aloof, to advance funds to secure the continuance of
Amir Khan’s aid. Two lakhs of rupees (£20,000) effected this
object; and the Khan, pledging himself to continue his support
to Raja Man, repaired to Jodhpur. The four chiefs who had
thus signalized themselves, preceded him, and were received
with open arms: their offences were forgiven, and their estates
restored, while Induraj was appointed Bakhshi or commander
of the forces [148].</div>

from Idar, and installed on “the gaddi of Jodha.” This course of proceeding
would meet universal approbation, with the exception of some selfish
miscreants about the person of this pretended son of Bhim, or the chieftain
of Pokaran, in furtherance of his and his grandfather’s yet unavenged
feud. A sketch of the events, drawn from their own chronicles, and accompanied

<h3 class='c024'>CHAPTER 15</h3>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Amīr Khān received at Jodhpur.</h4>—Amir Khan was received by
Raja Man with distinguished honours; a palace in the castle was
assigned as his residence; valuable gifts were presented to him
and great rewards held in perspective, if, through his agency,
the rebellion should be completely subdued. He swore to extirpate
Sawai’s faction, and in token of identity of views with
Raja Man, he was admitted to the honour of that last proof of
devotion to his cause, “an interchange of turbans,” with an
advance of three lakhs, or £30,000, for the immediate payment of
his bonds.</div>

<p class='c001'>On the raising of the siege of Jodhpur, Sawai conducted the
pretender to the appanage of the heirs of Marwar, the city of
Nagor. There they were deliberating as to their future plans,
when a message was brought from Amir Khan from [149]
Mundiawar,<a id='r5.15.1' /><a href='#f5.15.1' class='c013'><sup>[1]</sup></a> ten miles distant, begging permission to perform
his devotions at the shrine of the Muslim saint, Pir Tarkin, the
sole relic of the Islamite, which Bakhta Singh had spared. His
request being complied with, he with a slight cavalcade left his
camp, and having gone through the mummeries of devotion, paid
his respects to Sawai. When about to take leave, he threw out
hints of Raja Man’s ungrateful return for his services, and that
his legions might have been better employed. Sawai greedily
caught at the bait; he desired the Khan to name his terms, and
offered £200,000 on the day that Dhonkal should possess the
<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>gaddi</em></span> of Jodhpur. The Khan accepted the conditions and
ratified the engagement on the Koran, and to add to the solemnity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1090'>1090</span>of the pledge, he exchanged turbans with Sawai. This being done,
he was introduced to the pretender, received the usual gifts,
pledged his life in his cause, took leave, and returned to his camp,
whither he invited the prince and his chiefs on the following day
to accept of an entertainment.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Amīr Khān massacres the Chiefs.</h4>—On the morning of the 19th
of Chait, S. 1864 (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1808), Sawai, attended by the chief adherents
of the pretender and about five hundred followers, repaired to
the camp of the Khan, who had made every preparation for the
more effectual perpetration of the bloody and perfidious deed he
meditated. A spacious tent was pitched in the centre of his camp
for the reception of his guests, and cannon were loaded with
grape ready to be turned against them. The visitors were
received with the most distinguished courtesy; turbans were
again exchanged; the dancing-girls were introduced, and nothing
but festivity was apparent. The Khan arose, and making an
excuse to his guests for a momentary absence, retired. The
dancing continued, when at the word ‘<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>dhaga</em></span>,’ pronounced by
the musicians, down sunk the tent upon the unsuspicious Rajputs,
who fell an easy prey to the ferocious Pathans. Forty-two chieftains
were thus butchered in the very sanctuary of hospitality,
and the heads of the most distinguished were sent to Raja Man.
Their adherents, taken by surprise, were slaughtered by the
soldiery, or by cannon charged with grape, as they fled. The
pretender escaped from Nagor, which was plundered by the Khan,
when not only all the property of the party, but the immense
stores left by Bakhta Singh, including three hundred pieces of
cannon, were taken, and sent to Sambhar and other strongholds
held by the Khan. Having thus fulfilled his instructions, he
repaired to Jodhpur, and received ten lakhs or £100,000, and [150]
two large towns, Mundiawar and Kuchilawas, of thirty thousand
rupees annual rent, besides one hundred rupees daily for table-allowance,
as the reward of his signal infamy.</div>

<p class='c001'>Thus, by the murder of Sawai and his powerful partisans, the
confederacy against Raja Man was extinguished; but though
the Raja had thus, miraculously as it were, defeated the gigantic
schemes formed against him, the mode by which it was effected
entailed upon him and upon his country unexampled miseries.
The destruction of the party of the pretender was followed by
retaliation on the various members of the league. The Jaipur
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1091'>1091</span>territory was laid waste by the troops of Amir Khan, and an
expedition was planned against Bikaner. An army consisting
of twelve thousand of Raja Man’s feudal levies, under the command
of Induraj, with a brigade of Amir Khan, and that of
Hindal Khan with thirty-five guns, marched against the chief
of the independent Rathors. The Bikaner Raja formed an army
little inferior in numbers, and gave his suzerain the meeting at
Bapri; but after a partial encounter, in which the former lost
two hundred men, he fell back upon his capital, pursued by the
victors, who halted at Gajner.<a id='r5.15.2' /><a href='#f5.15.2' class='c013'><sup>[2]</sup></a> Here terms were offered; two
lakhs as the expenses of the war, and the surrender of the bone of
contention, the town of Phalodi, which had been assigned to
Bikaner as the price of joining the confederacy.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Amīr Khān rules Mārwār.</h4>—The Khan was now the arbiter
of Marwar. He stationed Ghafur Khan with a garrison in Nagor,
and partitioned the lands of Merta amongst his followers. He
likewise placed his garrison in the castle of Nawa, which gave
him the command of the salt-lakes of Nawa and Sambhar. Induraj
and the high-priest Deonath were the only counsellors of Raja
Man, and all the oppressions which the chieftains suffered through
this predominant foreign interference, were attributed to their
advice. To cut them off the chiefs in their turn applied to Amir
Khan, who for seven lakhs (£70,000), readily consented to rid
them of their enemies. A plot was laid, in which some of his
Pathans, under pretence of quarrelling with Induraj for their
arrears, put this minister and the high-priest to death.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Insanity of Mān Singh.</h4>—The loss of Deonath appeared to
affect the reason of Raja Man. He shut himself up in his apartments,
refused to communicate with any one, and soon omitted
every duty, whether political or religious, until at length he was
recommended to name his only son Chhattar Singh as his successor.
To this he acceded [151], and with his own hand made the mark
of inauguration on his forehead. But youth and base panders
to his pleasure seduced him from his duties, and he died, some
say the victim of illicit pursuits, others from a wound given by
the hand of one of the chieftains, whose daughter he attempted
to seduce.</div>

<p class='c001'>The premature death of his only son, before he had attained
the years of majority, still more alienated the mind of Raja Man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1092'>1092</span>from all State affairs, and his suspicions of treacherous attempts
on his person extended even to his wife. He refused all food,
except that which was brought by one faithful menial. He
neglected his ablutions, allowed his face to be covered with hair,
and at length either was, or affected to be insane. He spoke to
no one, and listened with the apathy of an idiot to the communications
of the ministers, who were compelled to carry on the government.
By many it is firmly believed that the part he thus acted
was feigned, to escape the snares laid for his life; while others
think that it was a melancholy mania, arising from remorse at
having consented to the murder of Induraj, which incidentally
involved that of the Guru.<a id='r5.15.3' /><a href='#f5.15.3' class='c013'><sup>[3]</sup></a> In short, his alliance with the
atrocious Khan exposed him to the suspicion of a participation
in his crimes, which the bent of his policy too much favoured.
In this condition—the government being managed by an oligarchy
headed by Salim Singh (son of Sawai)—did Raja Man remain,
until the tide of events carried the arms of Britain even to the
desert of Maru.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>British Intervention. Restoration of Mān Singh.</h4>—When, in
1817, we invited the Rajputs to disunite from the predatory
powers, and to join us in establishing order throughout India,
the young son of Raja Man, or rather his ministers, sent envoys
to Delhi. But ere the treaty was ratified, this dissipated youth
was no more. On this event, the Pokaran faction, dreading Raja
Man’s resumption of the government, made an application to
Idar for a son to adopt as their sovereign. But splendid as was
the offer, the Raja, who had but one son, rejected it, unless the
demand were sustained by the unanimous suffrages of the nobles.
Unanimity being unattainable, the faction had no alternative
save the restoration of Raja Man; but it was in vain they explained
the new position of Marwar, the alliance with the English,
which awaited his sanction, and the necessity that he, as the last
prop of the royal family, should resume the reins of power. He
listened to all with the most apathetic indifference [152]. But
although he saw in this new crisis of the political condition of his
country, motives for effecting his escape from bondage, his mind
was so tutored by bitter experience that he never for an instant
betrayed its workings. When at length he allowed himself to
comprehend the full nature of the changes which made even the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1093'>1093</span>faction desire his egress from solitude, so far from expressing any
joy, he even disapproved of part of the treaty, and especially the
article relating to the armed contingent of his vassals to be at
the disposal of the protecting power, in which he wisely saw the
germ of discord, from the certainty of interference it would lead to.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Treaty with the British.</h4>—It was in December 1817 that the
treaty<a id='r5.15.4' /><a href='#f5.15.4' class='c013'><sup>[4]</sup></a> was negotiated at Delhi by a Brahman named Byas
Bishan Ram, on the part of the regent prince, and in December
1818, an officer of the British government<a id='r5.15.5' /><a href='#f5.15.5' class='c013'><sup>[5]</sup></a> was deputed to report
on its actual condition. Notwithstanding the total disorganization
of the government, from the combination of causes already
described, the court had lost nothing of its splendour or regularity;
the honour of all was concerned in preserving the dignity of the
<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>gaddi</em></span>, though its incumbent was an object of distrust and even
detestation. The ministry at this period was conducted by Akhai
Chand (Diwan), and Salim Singh of Pokaran, as the representative
of the aristocracy, with the title of Bhanjghar. All the garrisons
and offices of trust throughout the country were held by the
creatures of a junto, of which these were the heads. There was,
however, already the nucleus of an opposition in the brother of
the murdered minister, named Fateh Raj, who was entrusted with
the care of the city. The instructions of the agent were to offer
the aid of the British government towards the settlement of Raja
Man’s affairs; and at a private interview, three days after the
agent’s arrival, troops were offered to be placed at his disposal.
But the wariness of his character will be seen in the use he made
of this offer. He felt that the lever was at hand to crush faction
to the dust; and with a Machiavellian caution, he determined
that the existence of this engine should suffice; that its power
should be felt, but never seen; that he should enjoy all the
advantages this influence would give, without risking any of its
dangers if called into action. Thus, while he rejected, though
with thanks, the essential benefit tendered, qualifying his refusal
with a sufficient reason—“reliance on himself to restore his State
to order”—he failed not to [153] disseminate the impression
amongst his chiefs, which was enough for his purpose, and which
besides checked the dictation and interference that uniformly
result from such unequal alliances.</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1094'>1094</span>Energetic counsels and rapid decision are unknown to Asiatic
governments, whose subjects are ever prone to suspicion whenever
unusual activity is visible; and Raja Man had been schooled
into circumspection from his infancy. He appeared anxious
to bury the past in oblivion, by choosing men of both parties for
the inferior duties of the ministry; and the blandness of his
manners and his conciliatory address lulled the most suspicious
into security. After a short residence, the Agent returned to
Ajmer, having in vain tried to convince Raja Man that his affairs
were irretrievable without the direct aid of the paramount power,
which he persisted in repudiating, assigning as his reason that he
felt convinced, from “the measures then in train,” he should
accomplish the task himself: of these measures conciliation
appeared to be the basis.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Author appointed Envoy to Jodhpur.</h4>—At this period<a id='r5.15.6' /><a href='#f5.15.6' class='c013'><sup>[6]</sup></a> an
envoy was appointed, with powers direct from the Governor-General
to Raja Man, but he was for some months prevented
from proceeding to his court, from various causes.<a id='r5.15.7' /><a href='#f5.15.7' class='c013'><sup>[7]</sup></a></div>

<div class='section-start'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1095'>1095</span><h4 class='disp-inline'>Demoralization at Jodhpur.</h4>—The Agent, who reached Jodhpur
early in the month of November, found matters [154] in nearly
the same state as on his predecessor’s departure in February.
The same faction kept the prince and all the officers of government
at their disposal. The Raja interfered but little with their
measures, except to acquiesce in or confirm them. The mercenary
bands of Sindis or Pathans were in miserable plight and clamorous
for their pay, not having been accounted with for three years;
and they were to be seen begging in the streets of the capital, or
hawking bundles of forage on their heads to preserve them from
starvation. On the approach of the Agent of the British Government,
the forms of accounts were gone through, and they gave
in acquittances in full of demands, on condition of receiving 30
per cent of their arrears; but this was only a form, and with his
departure (in about three weeks), they despaired even of that.</div>

<p class='c001'>The name of justice was unknown:—though, in allusion to
the religion of the men in power, it was common to hear it said,
“You may commit murder and no one will notice it; but woe
to him who beats or maims a brute, for dogs are publicly fed
while the soldier starves.” In short, the sole object of the faction
was to keep at a distance all interposition that might lead the
prince to emancipate himself from their control. During the
Agent’s stay of nearly three weeks, he had several private interviews
with Raja Man. The knowledge he had of the history of
his ancestry and his own situation, and of the causes which had
produced it, failed not to beget a corresponding confidence; and
these interviews were passed in discussions on the ancient history
of the country as well as on his own immediate affairs. The
Agent took leave with these words: “I know all the perils through
which you have passed; I am aware how you surmounted them.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1096'>1096</span>By your resolution, your external enemies are now gone: you
have the British Government as a friend; rely upon it with the
same fortitude, and, in a very short time, all will be as you could
desire.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Raja Man listened eagerly to these observations. His fine
features, though trained to bear no testimony to the workings
within, relaxed with delight as he rapidly replied, “In one twelve-months,
my affairs will be as friendship could wish.” To which
the Agent rejoined, “In half the time, Maharaja, if you are
determined”: though the points to which he had to direct his
mind were neither few nor slight, for they involved every branch
of government; as</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Reforms in Mārwār.</h4>—1. Forming an efficient administration
[155].</div>

<p class='c001'>2. Consideration of the finances; the condition of the crown
lands; the feudal confiscations, which, often unjust, had caused
great discontent.</p>

<p class='c001'>3. The reorganization and settlement of the foreign troops,
on whose service the Raja chiefly depended.</p>

<p class='c001'>4. An effective police on all the frontiers, to put down the
wholesale pillage of the Mers in the south, the Larkhanis in the
north, and the desert Sahariyas and Khosas in the west; reformation
of the tariff, or scale of duties on commerce, which were so
heavy as almost to amount to prohibition; and at the same time
to provide for its security.</p>

<p class='c001'>Scarcely had the Agent left Jodhpur, before the faction,
rejoiced at the removal of the only restraint on their narrow-minded
views, proceeded in the career of disorder. Whether the
object were to raise funds, or to gratify ancient animosities, the
course pursued by the Diwan and his junto was the same.
Ghanerao, the chief fief of Godwar, was put under sequestration,
and only released by a fine of more than a year’s revenue. All
the minor chiefs of this rich tract suffered in the same manner,
besides the indignity of having their lands placed under the control
of a brother of the minister. Chandawal<a id='r5.15.8' /><a href='#f5.15.8' class='c013'><sup>[8]</sup></a> was put under sequestration,
and only released on a very heavy fine. At length the Diwan
had the audacity to put his hand on Awa, the chief fief of Marwar;
but the descendant of Champa replied, “My estate is not of to-day,
nor thus to be relinquished.” Gloom, mistrust, and resentment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1097'>1097</span>pervaded the whole feudal body. They saw a contemptible
faction sporting with their honour and possessions, from an idea
they industriously propagated, that an unseen but mighty power
was at hand to support their acts, given out as those of the prince.
If the Raja did dictate them, he took especial care it should not
be seen; for in the absence of the British Agent, he once more
resumed his sequestered habits, and appeared to take no interest
in the government further than to promote a coalition between
Akhai Chand and Fateh Raj, who was supported by a strong
party of the chiefs, and the influence of the favourite queen. But
Akhai Chand, who commanded, through his creatures, all the
resources of the country, and its strongholds, even to the castle
of Jodhpur, rejected these overtures, and feigning that there
were plots against his personal safety, left the city; and the
better to exclude his adversaries from the prince, resided entirely
in the citadel.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Cruelty of Rāja Mān Singh.</h4>—Six months had thus fled. The
fiat of Akhai Chand was supreme; he alone was [156] visible;
his orders alone were obeyed. Raja Man was only heard of as
an automaton, moving as the Diwan pleased. But while the
latter was thus basking in the full sunshine of prosperity, enriching
himself and his dependents, execrated by the nobles and
envied by his fellow-citizens, they heard of his fall! Then, the
insanity of his master proved to be but a cloak to the intensity
of his resentment. But a blind revenge would not have satisfied
Raja Man. The victims of his deep dissimulation, now in
manacles, were indulged with hopes of life, which, with the
application of torture, made them reveal the plunder of prince
and subject. A schedule of forty lakhs, or £400,000, was given
in by the Diwan and his dependents, and their accounts being
settled in this world, they were summarily dismissed to the other,
with every mark of ignominy which could add to the horrors of
death. Nagji, the Kiladar,<a id='r5.15.9' /><a href='#f5.15.9' class='c013'><sup>[9]</sup></a> and misleader of the late regent
prince, with Mulji Dandal, one of the old allodial stock, had each
a cup of poison, and their bodies were thrown over the ‘Gate of
Victory’ (Fateh Pol). Jivaraj, a brother of the Dandal, with
Biharidas Khichi, and the tailor, had their heads shaved, and
their bodies were flung into the cascade beneath. Even the
sacred character of “expounder of the Vedas,” and that of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1098'>1098</span>“revealer of the secrets of heaven,” yielded no protection; and
Byas Sheodas, with Srikishan, Jotishi, the astrologer, were in
the long list of proscriptions. Nagji, commandant of the citadel,
and Mulji, had retired on the death of the regent-prince; and
with the wealth they had accumulated, while administering to
his follies, had erected places of strength. On the restoration of
Raja Man, and the general amnesty which prevailed, they returned
to their ancient offices in the castle, rose into favour, and
forgot they had been traitors. Having obtained their persons,
Man secured the ancient jewels of the crown, bestowed on these
favourites during the ephemeral sway of his son. Their condemnation
was then passed, and they were hurled over the battlements
of the rock which it was their duty to guard. With such
consummate skill was the plot contrived, that the creatures of
the minister, in the most remote districts, were imprisoned
simultaneously with himself. Of the many subordinate agents
thus confined, many were liberated on the disclosure of their
wealth; and by these sequestrations, Raja Man obtained
abundant supplies. The enormous sum of a crore, or near one
million sterling, was stated; but if they yielded one-half (and
this was not unlikely), they gave the means, which he was not
slow to use, for the prosecution of what he termed a just punishment,
though it [157] better deserves the name of a savage
revenge. Had he been satisfied with inflicting the last penalty
of the law on the nefarious Akhai Chand, and some of the household
officers whose fidelity ought ever to be firm, and with the
sequestration of the estates of some two or three of the vassals
whose power had become dangerous, or their treason too manifest
to be overlooked, he would have commanded the services of the
rest, and the admiration of all conversant with these events.
But this first success added fuel to his revenge, and he sought out
more noble victims to glut it. His circumspection and dissimulation
were strengthened, not relaxed, by his success. Several of
the chiefs, who were marked out for death, had received, only a
few days before, the highest proof of favour in additional lands
to their rent-roll, and accident alone prevented a group of the
most conspicuous from falling into the snare which had inveigled
Akhai Chand. Salim Singh of Pokaran, and his constant associate
Surthan of Nimaj, with Anar Singh of Ahor, and the minors of
their clans, whose duty daily carried them to the court, as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1099'>1099</span>chief advisers of the prince, formed a part of the administration
of the Diwan, and they naturally took alarm upon his confinement.
To obviate this, a deputation was sent by the prince to
tranquillize them by the assurance that, in the confinement of
the minister, whose rapacity and misconduct deserved punishment,
the Raja had attained all his ends. Thus, in order to
encompass the destruction of the Pokaran chief, he would not
have scrupled to involve all the rest. The prince, with his own
mouth, desired the confidential servant of Anar Singh, who was
his personal friend, to attend with the others. Their distrust
saved him. The same night, the mercenary bands, to the number
of eight thousand men, with guns, attacked Surthan Singh in his
dwelling. With one hundred and eighty of his clan, he defended
himself against great guns and small arms, as long as the house
was tenable, and then sallied out sword in hand, and, with his
brother and eighty of his kin, fell nobly in the midst of his foes.
The remainder retreated with their arms to defend Nimaj and
their infant chief. This gallant defence, in which many of the
townspeople were slain, prevented a repetition of the attempt
against the Pokaran chief, who remained on the defensive; until,
seeing an opportunity, he fled to his asylum in the desert, or he
would that day have renounced “the sheath of the dagger which
held the fortunes of Marwar,” and which now contained the
accumulated revenge of four generations: of Deo Singh, of
Sabhala, of Sawai, and his own. His death would have terminated
this branch of Ajit’s issue, adopted into the house of [158]
Pokaran, in the history of which we have a tolerable picture of
the precariousness of existence in Marwar.<a id='r5.15.10' /><a href='#f5.15.10' class='c013'><sup>[10]</sup></a></div>

<p class='c001'>What better commentary can be made on Raja Man’s character,
than the few recorded words addressed to Fateh Raj,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1100'>1100</span>whom he sent for to the Presence, on the day succeeding these
events? “Now you may perceive the reasons why I did not
sooner give you office.” This individual, the brother of the late
Induraj, was forthwith installed in the post of Diwan; and with
the sinews of war provided by the late sequestrations, the troops
were satisfied, while by the impression so sedulously propagated
and believed, that he had only to call on the British power for
what aid he required, the whole feudal body was appalled: and the
men, who would have hurled the tyrant from his throne, now only
sought to avoid his insidious snares, more dangerous than open force.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nimaj was besieged and nobly defended; but at length the
son of Surthan capitulated, on receiving the sign-manual of his
prince promising pardon and restoration, guaranteed by the
commander of the mercenary bands. To the eternal disgrace of
the Raja, he broke this pledge, and the boy had scarcely appeared
in the besieging camp, when the civil officer produced the Raja’s
mandate for his captivity and transmission to the Presence. If
it is painful to record this fact, it is pleasing to add, that even
the mercenary commander spurned the infamous injunction.
“No,” said he; “on the faith of my pledge (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>bachan</em></span>) he surrendered;
and if the Raja breaks his word, I will maintain mine,
and at least place him in security.” He kept his promise, and
conveyed him to the Aravalli mountains, whence he passed over
to, and received protection in Mewar.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Estrangement of the Chiefs.</h4>—This and similar acts of treachery
and cold-blooded tyranny completely estranged all the chiefs.
Isolated as they were, they could make no resistance against the
mercenary battalions, amounting to ten thousand men, exclusive
of the quotas; and they dared not league for defence, from the
dreaded threat held over them, of calling in the British troops;
and in a few months the whole feudal association of [159] Marwar
abandoned their homes and their country, seeking shelter in the
neighbouring States from the Raja’s cruel and capricious tyranny.
To his connexion with the British Government alone he was
indebted for his being able thus to put forth the resources of his
policy, which otherwise he never could have developed either
with safety or effect; nor at any former period of the history of
Marwar could the most daring of its princes have undertaken,
with any prospect of success, what Raja Man accomplished under
this alliance.</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1101'>1101</span>These brave men found asyla in the neighbouring States of
Kotah, Mewar, Bikaner, and Jaipur. Even the faithful Anar
Singh, whose fidelity no gratitude could ever repay, was obliged
to seek refuge in exile. He had stood Man’s chief shield against
the proscription of Raja Bhim, when cooped up in Jalor, and sold
his wife’s ornaments, “even to her nose-ring,” to procure him
the means of subsistence and defence. It was Anar Singh who
saved him when, in the attempt upon Pali, he was unhorsed and
nearly made prisoner. He was among the four chiefs who
remained by his fortunes when the rest deserted to the standard
of the pretender; and he was one of the same body, who rescued
the trophies of their disgrace from the hands of their enemies
when on the road to Jaipur. Last of all, he was mainly instrumental
in the Raja’s emancipation and in his resumption of the
reins of government. Well might the fury of his revenge deserve
the term of madness! In <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1821, the greater chieftains of
Marwar, thus driven into exile, were endeavouring to obtain the
mediation of the British authorities; but another year had
elapsed without the slightest advance to accommodation. Their
conduct has been exemplary, but their degrading position,
dependent on the scanty resources of others, must of itself work
a cure. Their manly remonstrance addressed to the British
functionary is already before the reader.<a id='r5.15.11' /><a href='#f5.15.11' class='c013'><sup>[11]</sup></a> He did not hesitate
to tell them, that if in due time no mediation was held out, they
must depend on themselves for redress!</p>

<p class='c001'>Such was the political condition of Marwar until the year
1823. Had a demoniacal spirit of revenge not blinded Raja
Man, he had a fine opportunity to lay the principles of order on
a permanent basis, and to introduce those reforms necessary for
his individual welfare as well as for that of the State. He had
it in his power to modify the institutions, to curb without destroying
the feudal chiefs, and [160] to make the whole subservient
to the altered condition of affairs. Instead of having the glory
of fixing the constitution of his country, he has (reposing on
external protection) broken up the entire feudal association, and
rendered the paramount power an object of hatred instead of
reverence.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Retrospect of Mārwār History.</h4>—Having thus rapidly sketched
the history of this interesting branch of the Rajput race, from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1102'>1102</span>the destruction of their ancient seat of empire, Kanauj, and their
settlement in the Indian desert more than six centuries ago, to
the present day, it is impossible to quit the subject without a
reflection on the anomalous condition of their alliance with the
British Government, which can sanction the existence of such a
state of things as we have just described. It illustrates the
assertions made in an early part of this work,<a id='r5.15.12' /><a href='#f5.15.12' class='c013'><sup>[12]</sup></a> of the ill-defined
principles which guide all our treaties with the Rajputs, and
which, if not early remedied, will rapidly progress to a state of
things full of misery to them, and of inevitable danger to ourselves.
These “men of the soil,” as they emphatically designate
themselves, cling to it, and their ancient and well-defined privileges,
with an unconquerable pertinacity; in their endeavours
to preserve them, whole generations have been swept away, yet
has their strength increased in the very ratio of oppression.
Where are now the oppressors? the dynasties of Ghazni, of Ghor,
the Khiljis, the Lodis, the Pathans, the Timurs, and the demoralizing
Mahratta? The native Rajput has flourished amidst these
revolutions, and survived their fall; and but for the vices of
their internal sway, chiefly contracted from such association,
would have risen to power upon the ruin of their tyrants. But
internal dissension invited the spoiler; and herds of avaricious
Mahrattas and ferocious Pathans have reaped the harvest of their
folly. Yet all these faults were to be redeemed in their alliances
with a people whose peculiar boast was, that wisdom, justice, and
clemency were the corner-stones of their power: seeking nothing
from them beyond the means for their defence, and an adherence
to the virtues of order. How far the protecting power has
redeemed its pledge, in allowing years to pass away without some
attempt to remedy the anarchy we have described, the reader is
in a condition to judge. If it be said that we have tied up our
hands by leaving them free agents in their internal administration,
then let no offer of support be given to the head, for the
oppression of the vassal and his rights, co-equal with those of
the sovereign [161]; and if our mediation cannot be exerted, let
us withdraw altogether the checks upon the operation of their
own system of government, and leave them free agents in reality.
A wiser, more humane, and liberal policy would be, to impose
upon ourselves the task of understanding their political condition,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1103'>1103</span>and to use our just influence for the restoration of their internal
prosperity, and with it the peace, present as well as prospective,
of an important part of our empire. The policy which such views
would suggest, is to support the opinion of the vast majority of
the Rathors, and to seize the first opportunity to lend at least
our sanction to an adoption, from the Idar branch, of Rathor
blood, not only uncontaminated, but heirs-presumptive to Jodha,
and exclude the parricidal line which will continue to bring misery
on the country. If, however, we apply only our own monarchical,
nay, despotic principles to this feudal society, and interfere but
to uphold a blind tyranny, which must drive these brave chiefs
to despair, it will be well to reflect and consider, from the acts we
have related, of what they are capable. Very different, indeed,
would be the deeds of proscribed Rajputs from those of vagabond
Pindaris, or desultory Mahrattas; and what a field for aggression
and retreat! Rumour asserts that they have already done
themselves justice; and that, driven to desperation, and with no
power to mediate, the dagger has reached the heart of Raja Man!
If this be true, it is a retribution which might have been expected;
it was the only alternative left to the oppressed chiefs to do themselves
justice. It is also said, that the ‘pretended’ son of Raja
Bhim is now on the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>gaddi</em></span> of Jodha. This is deeply to be lamented.
Raja Dhonkal will see only the party who espoused his pretensions,
and the Pokaran chief and faction will hold that place in
the councils of his sovereign, which of right belongs to the head
of his clan, the Champawat chief of Awa, an exile in Mewar.<a id='r5.15.13' /><a href='#f5.15.13' class='c013'><sup>[13]</sup></a>
Jealousy, feuds, and bloodshed will be the consequence, which
would at once be averted by an adoption from Idar. Were a
grand council of Rajputs to be convened, in order to adjust the
question, nine-tenths would decide as proposed; the danger of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1104'>1104</span>interference would be neutralized, and peace and tranquillity
would be the boon bestowed upon thousands, and, what is of
some consequence, future danger to ourselves would be avoided

<p class='c001'><a href='#r5.15.7'>7</a>. One of these was an unpleasant altercation, which took place between
the townspeople of the Commercial Mart of Pali and an English gentleman,
sent unofficially to feel his way as to the extension of commercial enterprise,
carrying specimens of the staple commodities of our trade. This interference
with the very fountain-head of their trade alarmed the monopolists
of Pali, who, dreading such competition, created or took advantage of an
incident to rid themselves of the intruder. The commercial men of these
regions almost all profess the Jain religion, whose first rule of faith is the
preservation of life, in beast as in man. By them, therefore, the piece-goods,
the broad-cloths and metals of the Christian trader, were only less
abhorred than his flesh-pots, and the blood of the goats sworn to have been
shed by his servants within the bounds of Pali, rose in judgment against
their master, of whom a formal complaint was laid before Raja Man. It
lost none of its acrimony in coming through the channel of his internuncio
at Udaipur, the Brahman, Bishan Ram. Mr. Rutherford rebutted the
charge, and an investigation took place at the capital on oath, upon which,
as the merchants and the governor of Pali (a nephew of the minister) could
not substantiate their charge, the latter was severely reprimanded for his
incivility. But whether the story was true or false, it was quite enough
for their purpose. The interdict between Mr. Rutherford and the inhabitants
of Pali was more effectual than the sanitary cordon of any prince in
Christendom. The feeling of resentment against him reached the Agent
of government, who was obliged to support what appeared the cause of
truth, even according to the deposition made before their own judgment-seat,
and he was consequently deemed inimical to the prince and the faction
which then guided his councils. Mr. Rutherford proceeded afterwards to
Kotah, to exhibit the same wares; but he was there equally an object of
jealousy, though from letters of recommendation from the Agent, it was
less strongly manifested. It furnished evidence that such interference
would never succeed. It is well his mission did not appear to be sanctioned
by the government. What evil might not be effected by permitting unrestricted
and incautious intercourse with such people, who can, and do
obtain all they require of our produce without the presence of the producers,
who, whether within or without the pale of the Company’s service, will not,
I trust, be prematurely forced on Rajputana, or it will assuredly hasten the
day of inevitable separation!</p>

the line of necessity, either for the ends of justice or security. If he stops
with the Pokaran chief, and one or two inferior, concerned in the coalition
of 1806 and the usurpation of his son, with the condign punishment of a
few of the civil officers, it will afford a high opinion of his character; but
if he involves Awa, and the other principal chiefs, in these proscriptions,
he may provoke a strife which will yet overwhelm him. He has done
enough for justice, and even for revenge, which has been carried too far
as regards Surthan Singh, whose death (which I sincerely regret) was a
prodigal sacrifice.”</p>

demanded aid from the British Government, which was refused. “At the

engagements with Government by having allowed an armed confederacy
to form against Jodhpur within its territory, and strong remonstrances
were addressed to the Darbār; lastly, Dhonkal Singh was required to
withdraw from the confederacy, and the nobles settled their differences
among themselves” (Erskine iii. A. 72). In 1839 the misgovernment of
Mān Singh led to British military intervention. He died on 5th September
1843.]</p>

<h3 class='c024'>CHAPTER 16</h3>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Extent of Mārwār.</h4>—The extreme breadth of Marwar lies
between two points in the parallel of the capital, namely, Girab,
west, and Shamgarh, on the Aravalli range, east. This line
measures two hundred and seventy British miles. The greatest
length, from the Sirohi frontier to the northern boundary, is
about two hundred and twenty miles.<a id='r5.16.1' /><a href='#f5.16.1' class='c013'><sup>[1]</sup></a> From the remote angle,
N.N.E., in the Didwana district, to the extremity of Sanchor,
S.W., the diagonal measurement is three hundred and fifty miles.
The limits of Marwar are, however, so very irregular, and present
so many salient angles and abutments into other States, that
without a trigonometrical process we cannot arrive at a correct
estimate of its superficial extent: a nicety not, indeed,
required.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Physical Features, Population.</h4>—The most marked feature
that diversifies the face of Maru is the river Luni, which, rising
on her eastern frontier at Pushkar, and pursuing a westerly course,
nearly bisects the country, and forms the boundary between the
fertile and sterile lands of Maru. But although the tracts south
of this stream, between it and the Aravalli, are by far the richest
part of Marwar, it would be erroneous to describe all the northern
part as sterile. An ideal line, passing through Nagor and Jodhpur,
to Balotra, will mark the just distinction. South of this line will
lie the districts of Didwana, Nagor, Merta, Jodhpur, Pali, Sojat,
Godwar, Siwana, Jalor, Bhinmal, and Sanchor, most of which are
fertile and populous; and we may [163] assign a population of
eighty souls to the square mile. The space north of this line is
of a very different character, but this requires a subdivision; for
while the north-east portion, which includes a portion of Nagor,
the large towns of Phalodi, Pokaran, etc., may be calculated at
thirty, the remaining space to the south-west, as Gugadeo-ka-thal,
or ‘desert of Guga,’ Sheo, Barmer, Kotra, and Chhotan, can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1105'>1105</span>scarcely be allowed ten. In round numbers, the population of
Marwar may be estimated at two millions of souls.<a id='r5.16.2' /><a href='#f5.16.2' class='c013'><sup>[2]</sup></a></div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Classes of Inhabitants.</h4>—Of this amount, the following is the
classification of the tribes. The Jats constitute five-eighths, the
Rajputs two-eighths,<a id='r5.16.3' /><a href='#f5.16.3' class='c013'><sup>[3]</sup></a> while the remaining classes, sacerdotal,<a id='r5.16.4' /><a href='#f5.16.4' class='c013'><sup>[4]</sup></a> commercial,
and servile, make up the integral number. If this calculation
be near the truth, the Rajputs, men, women, and children,
will amount to five hundred thousand souls, which would admit
of fifty thousand men capable of bearing arms, especially when
we recollect that the Jats or Jāts are the industrious class.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Rāthors.</h4>—It is superfluous to expatiate on the peculiarities
of the Rathor character, which we have endeavoured to extract
from their own actions. It stands deservedly high in the scale
of the “Thirty-six Tribes,” and although debased by one besetting
sin (the use of opium), the Rathor is yet a noble animal, and
requires only some exciting cause to show that the spirit, which
set at defiance the resources of the empire in the zenith of its
prosperity, is dormant only, not extinct. The reign of the present
prince has done more, however, than even the arms of Aurangzeb,
to deteriorate the Rathors. Peace would recruit their thinned
ranks, but the mistrust sown in every house by unheard-of
duplicity, has greatly demoralized the national character, which
until lately stood higher than that of any of the circumjacent
tribes. A popular prince, until within these very few years,
could easily have collected a magnificent army, <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>ek bap ke bete</em></span>,
‘the sons of one father,’ round the ‘<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>gaddi</em></span> of Jodha’: in fact,
the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>panchas hazar tarwar Rathoran</em></span>, meaning the ‘fifty thousand
Rathor swords,’ is the proverbial phrase to denote the muster of
Maru, of which they estimated five thousand cavalry. This was
exclusive of the household and foreign troops supported on the
fiscal lands. The Rathor cavalry was the best in India. There
were several horse-fairs, especially those of Balotra and Pushkar
where the horses of [164] Cutch and Kathiawar, the Jungle, and
Multan, were brought in great numbers. Valuable horses were
also bred on the western frontier, on the Luni, those of Rardara
being in high estimation. But the events of the last twenty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1106'>1106</span>years appear to have dried up every source of supply. The
breeding studs of Rardara, Cutch, and the Jungle are almost
extinct, and supplies from the west of the Indus are intercepted
by the Sikhs.<a id='r5.16.5' /><a href='#f5.16.5' class='c013'><sup>[5]</sup></a> The destruction of the predatory system, which
created a constant demand, appears to have lessened the supply.
So much for the general peace which the successes of Britain have
produced.</div>

<p class='c001'>In periods of civil commotion, or when the safety of the State
was perilled, we hear of one clan (the Champawat) mustering four
thousand horse. But if ever so many of “the sons of Champa”
were congregated at one time, it is an extraordinary occurrence,
and far beyond the demand which the State has upon their
loyalty. To estimate what may be demanded of them, we have
only to divide the rent-roll by five hundred rupees, the qualification
for a cavalier in Maru, and to add, for each horse, two
foot-soldiers. A schedule of the greater feudal estates shall be
appended.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Soil, Agriculture, Products.</h4>—The following is the classification
of the different heads of soil in Marwar: Bekal, Chikni, Pīla,
and Safed. The first (whose etymology I know not) pervades
the greater part of the country, being a light sand, having little
or no earthy admixture, and only fit to produce <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>bajra</em></span> (millet),
<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>mung</em></span>, <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>moth</em></span> (pulse), <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>til</em></span> (sesamum), melons and <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>gawar</em></span>.<a id='r5.16.6' /><a href='#f5.16.6' class='c013'><sup>[6]</sup></a> Chikni
(fat), a black earth, pervades the district of Didwana, Merta, Pali,
and several of the feudal lands in Godwar. Wheat and grain are
its products. The Pīla (yellow) is a sandy clay, chiefly about
Khinwasar<a id='r5.16.7' /><a href='#f5.16.7' class='c013'><sup>[7]</sup></a> and the capital, also Jalor and Balotra, and portions
of other districts. It is best adapted for barley, and that kind
of wheat called <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>pattagehun</em></span> (the other is <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>kathagehun</em></span>);<a id='r5.16.8' /><a href='#f5.16.8' class='c013'><sup>[8]</sup></a> also
tobacco, onions, and other vegetables: the staple millets are
seldom grown in this. The Safed (white) is almost pure silex,
and grows little or nothing, but after heavy falls of rain.<a id='r5.16.9' /><a href='#f5.16.9' class='c013'><sup>[9]</sup></a></div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1107'>1107</span>The districts south of the Luni, as Pali, Sojat, and Godwar,
fertilized by the numerous petty streams flowing from the Aravalli,
produce abundantly every species of grain with the exception of
<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>bajra</em></span>, which thrives best in a sandy soil; and in Nagor and
Merta considerable quantities of the richer grains are raised by
irrigation from wells. The extensive western divisions of Jalor,
Sanchor, and Bhinmal, containing [165] five hundred and ten
towns and villages, which are Khalisa, or ‘fiscal land,’ possess
an excellent soil, with the advantage of the rills from Abu, and
the great southern barrier; but the demoralized government of
Raja Man never obtains from them one-third of their intrinsic
capability, while the encroachment of the Sahariyas, and other
robbers from the Sindi desert, encroach upon them often with
impunity. Wheat, barley, rice, <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>juar</em></span> (millet), <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>mung</em></span> (pulse), <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>til</em></span>
(sesamum), are the chief products of the richer lands; while
amidst the sandy tracts they are confined to <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>bajra</em></span>, <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>mung</em></span>, and <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>til</em></span>.
With good government, Marwar possesses abundance of means
to collect stores against the visitations which afflict these northern
regions: but prejudice steps in to aid the ravages of famine, and
although water is near the surface in all the southern districts,
the number of wells bears no proportion to those in Mewar. The
great district of Nagor, of five hundred and sixty towns and
villages, the appanage of the heirs-apparent of Maru, in spite of
physical difficulties, is, or has been made, an exception; and the
immense sheet of sandstone, on which a humid soil is embedded,
has been pierced throughout by the energies of ancient days, and
contains greater aids to agriculture than many more fertile tracts
in the country.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Natural Productions.</h4>—Marwar can boast of some valuable
productions of her sterile plains, which make her an object of no
little importance in the most distant and more favoured regions
of India. The salt lakes of Pachbhadra, Didwana, and Sambhar,
are mines of wealth, and their produce is exported over the
greater part of Hindustan; while to the marble quarries of
Makrana (which gives its name to the mineral), on her eastern
frontier, all the splendid edifices of the imperial cities owe
their grandeur. The materials used in the palaces of Delhi,
Agra, their mosques, and tombs, have been conveyed from
Marwar.<a id='r5.16.10' /><a href='#f5.16.10' class='c013'><sup>[10]</sup></a> The quarries, until of late years, yielded a considerable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1108'>1108</span>revenue; but the age for palace-building in these regions is no
more, and posterity will ask with surprise the sources of such
luxury. There are also limestone quarries near Jodhpur and
Nagor; and the concrete called <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>kankar</em></span> is abundant in many of
the districts, and chiefly used for mortar. Tin and lead are
found at Sojat; alum about Pali, and iron is obtained from
Bhinmal and the districts adjoining Gujarat.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Manufactures.</h4>—The manufactures of Marwar are of no great
importance in a commercial point of view. Abundance of coarse
cotton cloths, and blankets, are [166] manufactured from the
cotton and wool produced in the country, but they are chiefly
used there. Matchlocks, swords, and other warlike implements
are fabricated at the capital and at Pali; and at the latter place
they make boxes of iron, tinned, so as to resemble the tin boxes
of Europe. Iron platters for culinary purposes are in such great
demand as to keep the forges constantly going.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Commercial Marts.</h4>—None of these States are without traffic;
each has her mart, or entrepôt; and while Mewar boasts of
Bhilwara, Bikaner of Churu, and Amber of Malpura (the city of
wealth), the Rathors claim Pali, which is not only the rival of the
places just mentioned, but may make pretensions to the title of
emporium of Rajputana. These pretensions we may the more
readily admit, when we recollect that nine-tenths of the bankers
and commercial men of India are natives of Marudes, and these
chiefly of the Jain faith. The laity of the Khadatara sect send
forth thousands to all parts of India, and the Oswals, so termed
from the town of Osian, near the Luni, estimate one hundred
thousand families whose occupation is commerce. All these
claim a Rajput descent, a fact entirely unknown to the European
enquirer into the peculiarities of Hindu manners. The wealth
acquired in foreign lands, from the Sutlej to the ocean, returns
chiefly to their native soil; but as neither primogeniture nor
<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>majorats</em></span> are sanctioned by the Jain lawgivers, an equal distribution
takes place amongst all the sons, though the youngest (as
amongst the Getae of Asia, and the Jutes of Kent), receives often
a double portion. This arises when the division takes place while
the parent is living, being the portion set apart for his own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1109'>1109</span>support, which ultimately falls to the youngest, with whom he
probably resides. It would be erroneous to say this practice is
extensive; though sufficient instances exist to suppose it once
was a principle.<a id='r5.16.11' /><a href='#f5.16.11' class='c013'><sup>[11]</sup></a> The bare enumeration of the tribes following
commerce would fill a short chapter. A priest of the Jains [167]
(my own teacher), who had for a series of years devoted his
attention to form a catalogue, which then amounted to nearly
eighteen hundred classes, renounced the pursuit, on obtaining
from a brother priest, from a distant region, one hundred and
fifty new names to add to his list.</div>

<p class='c001'>Pali was the entrepôt for the eastern and western regions,
where the productions of India, Kashmir, and China, were interchanged
for those of Europe, Africa, Persia, and Arabia. Caravans
(<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>kitars</em></span>), from the ports of Cutch and Gujarat, imported elephants’
teeth, copper, dates, gum-arabic, borax, coco-nuts, broadcloths,
silks, sandal-wood, camphor, dyes, drugs, oxide and sulphuret of
arsenic, spices, coffee, etc. In exchange, they exported chintzes,
dried fruits, <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>jira</em></span>,<a id='r5.16.12' /><a href='#f5.16.12' class='c013'><sup>[12]</sup></a> asafoetida from Multan, sugar, opium (Kotah
and Malwa), silks and fine cloths, potash, shawls, dyed blankets,
arms, and salt of home manufacture.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Caravans.</h4>—The route of the caravans was by Suigam,<a id='r5.16.13' /><a href='#f5.16.13' class='c013'><sup>[13]</sup></a> Sanchor,
Bhinmal, Jalor to Pali, and the guardians of the merchandise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1110'>1110</span>were almost invariably Charans, a character held sacred by the
Rajput. The most desperate outlaw seldom dared to commit
any outrage on caravans under the safeguard of these men,
the bards of the Rajputs. If not strong enough to defend
their convoy with sword and shield, they would threaten
the robbers with the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>chandni</em></span>, or ‘self-immolation’;<a id='r5.16.14' /><a href='#f5.16.14' class='c013'><sup>[14]</sup></a> and
proceed by degrees from a gash in the flesh to a death-wound,
or if one victim was insufficient a whole body of women
and children was sacrificed (as in the case of the Bamaniya
Bhats), for whose blood the marauder is declared responsible
hereafter.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Decay of Commerce. The Opium Trade.</h4>—Commerce has been
almost extinguished within these last twenty years; and paradoxical
as it may appear, there was tenfold more activity and
enterprise in the midst of that predatory warfare, which rendered
India one wide arena of conflict, than in these days of universal
pacification. The torpedo touch of monopoly has had more
effect on the Kitars than the spear of the desert Sahariya, or
Barwatia (outlaw) Rajput—against its benumbing qualities the
Charan’s dagger would fall innocuous; it sheds no blood, but
it dries up its channels. If the products of the salt-lakes of
Rajputana were preferred, even at Benares, to the sea-salt of
Bengal, high impost duties excluded it from the market. If the
opium of Malwa and Haraoti competed in the China market with
our Patna monopoly, again we intervened, not with high export
duties, which we were competent to impose, but by laying our
shackles upon it at the fountain-head. “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Aut Caesar, aut nullus</em></span>,”
is our maxim [168] in these regions; and in a country where our
Agents are established only to preserve political relations and
the faith of treaties, the basis of which is non-interference in the
internal arrangement of their affairs—albeit we have not a single
foot of land in sovereignty—we set forth our <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>parwanas</em></span>, as peremptory
as any Russian ukase, and command that no opium shall
leave these countries for the accustomed outlets, under pain of
confiscation. Some, relying on their skill in eluding our vigilance,
or tempted by the high price which these measures produce, or
perhaps reckoning upon our justice, and upon impunity if discovered,
tried new routes, until confiscation brought them to
submission.</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1111'>1111</span>We then put an arbitrary value upon the drug, and forced the
grower to come to us, and even take credit to ourselves for consulting
his interests. Even admitting that such price was a
remunerating one, founded upon an average of past years, still
it is not the less arbitrary. No allowance is made for plentiful
or bad seasons, when the drug, owing to a scarcity, will bear a
double price. Our legislation is for “all seasons and their change.”
But this virtual infraction of the faith of treaties is not confined
to the grower or retailer; it affects others in a variety of ways;
it injures our reputation and the welfare of those upon whom,
for benevolent purposes, we have forced our protection. The
transit duties levied on opium formed an item in the revenues of
the princes of Rajputana; but confiscation guards the passes
of the Aravalli and Gujarat, and unless the smuggler wrap up
his cargo in ample folds of deceit, the Rajput may go without
his <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>amal-pani</em></span>, the infusion of this poison, dearer to him than
life. It is in vain to urge that sufficient is allowed for home
consumption. Who is to be the judge of this? or who is so blind
as not to see that any latitude of this kind would defeat the
monopoly, which, impolitic in its origin, gave rise in its progress
to fraud, gambling, and neglect of more important agricultural
economy. But this policy must defeat itself: the excess of
quantity produced will diminish the value of the original (Patna)
monopoly, if its now deteriorated quality should fail to open the
eyes of the quick-sighted Chinese, and exclude it from the market
altogether.<a id='r5.16.15' /><a href='#f5.16.15' class='c013'><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Fairs.</h4>—There were two annual fairs in his country, Mundwa
and Balotra; the first chiefly for cattle. The merchandise of
various countries was exposed [169] and purchased by the merchants
of the adjoining States. It commenced with the month of
Magh, and lasted during six weeks. The other was also for cattle
of all kinds, horses, oxen, camels, and the merchandise enumerated
amongst the imports and exports of Pali. Persons from all parts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1112'>1112</span>of India frequented them; but all these signs of prosperity are
vanishing.<a id='r5.16.16' /><a href='#f5.16.16' class='c013'><sup>[16]</sup></a></div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Administration of Justice.</h4>—The administration of justice is
now very lax in these communities; but at no time were the
customary criminal laws of Rajputana sanguinary, except in
respect to political crimes, which were very summarily dealt
with when practicable. In these feudal associations, however,
such crimes are esteemed individual offences, and the whole power
of the government is concentrated to punish them; but when
they are committed against the community, justice is tempered
with mercy, if not benumbed by apathy. In cases even of
murder, it is satisfied with fine, corporal punishment, imprisonment,
confiscation, or banishment. Inferior crimes, such as
larcenies, were punished by fine and imprisonment, and, when
practicable, restitution; or, in case of inability to pay, corporal
punishment and confinement. But under the present lax system,
when this impoverished government has to feed criminals, it
may be supposed that their prisons are not overstocked. Since
Raja Bijai Singh’s death, the judgment-seat has been vacant.
His memory is held in high esteem for the administration of
justice, though he carried clemency to excess. He never confirmed
a sentence of death; and there is a saying of the criminals,
yet extant, more demonstrative of his humanity than of good
policy: “When at large we cannot even get <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>rabri</em></span> (porridge),
but in prison we eat <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>laddu</em></span> (sweetmeat).” Here, as at Jaipur,
confined criminals are maintained by individual charity; and
it is a well-known fact, that at the latter place, but for the
humanity of the mercantile classes, especially those of the Jain
persuasion, they might starve. Perhaps it is the knowledge of
this circumstance, which holds back the hand of the government,
or its agents, who may apply to their own uses the prison-fare.
When once confined, the criminals are little thought of, and
neglect answers all the ends of cruelty. They have, however,
a source of consolation unknown to those who have passed “the
bridge of sighs,” or become inmates of the oubliettes of more
civilized regions. That fortitude and resignation which religion
alone can bestow on the one is obtained through superstition
by the other; and the prayers of the prison are poured forth for
one of those visitations of Providence [170], which, in humbling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1113'>1113</span>the proud, prompts acts of mercy to others in order to ensure
it to themselves.<a id='r5.16.17' /><a href='#f5.16.17' class='c013'><sup>[17]</sup></a> The celestial phenomena of eclipses, whether
of the sun or moon, although predicted by the Pandits, who for
ages have possessed the most approved theory for calculation,
are yet looked upon with religious awe by the mass, and as “foreboding
change to princes.” Accordingly, when darkness dims
the beams of Surya or Chandra, the face of the prisoner of Maru
is lighted up with smiles; his deliverance is at hand, and he may
join the crowd to hoot and yell, and frighten the monster Rahu<a id='r5.16.18' /><a href='#f5.16.18' class='c013'><sup>[18]</sup></a>
from his hold of the “silver-moon.”<a id='r5.16.19' /><a href='#f5.16.19' class='c013'><sup>[19]</sup></a> The birth of a son to the
prince, and a new reign, are events likewise joyful to him.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Trial by Ordeal.</h4>—The trial by <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>sagun</em></span>, literally ‘oath of purgation,’
or ordeal, still exists, and is occasionally had recourse to
in Maru, as in other parts of Rajputana; and, if fallen into
desuetude, it is not that these judgments of God (as they were
styled in the days of European barbarism) are less relied on, but
that society is so unhinged that even these appeals to chance
find no subjects for practice, excepting by Zalim Singh; and he
to the last carried on his antipathy to the Dakins (witches) of
Haraoti, who were always submitted to the process by ‘water.’
Trial by ordeal is of very ancient date in India: it was by ‘fire’
that Rama proved the purity of Sita, after her abduction by
Ravana, and in the same manner as practised by one of our
Saxon kings, by making her walk over a red-hot ploughshare.<a id='r5.16.20' /><a href='#f5.16.20' class='c013'><sup>[20]</sup></a>
Besides the two most common tests, by fire and water, there is
a third, that of washing the hands in boiling oil. It should be
stated, that, in all cases, not only the selection but the appeal
to any of these ordeals is the voluntary act of the litigants, and
chiefly after the Panchayats, or courts <a id='corr1113.29'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='or'>of</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_1113.29'><ins class='correction' title='or'>of</ins></a></span> arbitration, have
failed. Where justice is denied, or bribery shuts the door, the
sufferer will dare his adversary to the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>sagun</em></span>, or submission to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1114'>1114</span>judgment of God; and the solemnity of the appeal carries such
weight, that it brings redress of itself, though cases do occur
where the challenge is accepted, and the author has conversed
with individuals who have witnessed the operation of each of
the ordeals.<a id='r5.16.21' /><a href='#f5.16.21' class='c013'><sup>[21]</sup></a></div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Panchayats.</h4>—The Panchayats arbitrate in civil cases. From
these courts of equity, there is an appeal to the Raja; but as
unanimity is required in the judges, and a fee or fine must be paid
by the appellant, ere his case can come before the prince [171],
litigation is checked. The constitution of this court is simple.
The plaintiff lays his case before the Hakim of the district, or
the Patel of the village where he resides. The plaintiff and
defendant have the right of naming the villages (two, each), from
whence the members of the Panchayat are to be drawn. Information
is accordingly sent to the Patels of the villages specified, who,
with their respective Patwaris (Registers), meet at the Atai or
‘village-court.’ Witnesses are summoned and examined on oath,
the most common of which is the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>gaddi-ki-an</em></span>, ‘allegiance to the
throne,’ resembling the ancient adjuration of the Scythians as
recorded by Herodotus.<a id='r5.16.22' /><a href='#f5.16.22' class='c013'><sup>[22]</sup></a> This oath is, however, more restricted
to Rajputs; the other classes have various forms based upon
their religious notions. When the proceedings are finished, and
judgment is given, the Hakim puts his seal thereto, and carries
it into effect, or prepares it for appeal. It is affirmed that, in
the good times of Rajputana, these simple tribunals answered
every purpose.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Fiscal Revenues.</h4>—The fiscal revenues of Marwar are derived
from various sources; the principal are—</div>

  <ul  class='ul_2'>
    <li>1. The Khalisa, or ‘crown-lands.’
    </li>
    <li>2. The salt lakes.
    </li>
    <li>3. Transit and impost duties.
    </li>
    <li>4. Miscellaneous taxes, termed Hasil.
    </li>
  </ul>

<p class='c001'>The entire amount of personal revenue of the princes of Marwar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1115'>1115</span>does not at present exceed ten lakhs of rupees (£100,000 sterling),
though in the reign of Bijai Singh half a century ago, they yielded
full sixteen lakhs, one-half of which arose from the salt lakes alone.
The aggregate revenue of the feudal lands is estimated as high
as fifty lakhs, or £500,000. It may be doubted whether at present
they yield half this sum.<a id='r5.16.23' /><a href='#f5.16.23' class='c013'><sup>[23]</sup></a> The feudal contingents are estimated
at five thousand horse, besides foot, the qualification being one
cavalier and two foot-soldiers for every thousand rupees of
income.<a id='r5.16.24' /><a href='#f5.16.24' class='c013'><sup>[24]</sup></a> This low estimate is to keep up the nominal value of
estates, notwithstanding their great deterioration; for a ‘knight’s
fee’ of Marwar was formerly estimated at five hundred rupees.</p>

<p class='c001'>The sum of ten lakhs, mentioned as the gross income of the
prince, is what is actually realized by the treasury, for there are
many public servants provided for out of the crown-lands, whose
estates are not included.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Methods of Revenue Collection.</h4>—The revenues are collected
from the ryots in kind. A corn-rent, the only one recognized in
ancient India, and termed Batai, or ‘division,’ is apportioned
equally [172] between the prince and the husbandman: a deviation
from the more lenient practice of former times, which gave
one-fourth, or one-sixth to the sovereign. Besides this, the
cultivator has to pay the expense of guarding the crops, and also
those who attend the process of division. An assessment of two
rupees is made on every ten maunds,<a id='r5.16.25' /><a href='#f5.16.25' class='c013'><sup>[25]</sup></a> which more than covers
the salaries paid to the Shahnas (watchmen), and Kanwaris,<a id='r5.16.26' /><a href='#f5.16.26' class='c013'><sup>[26]</sup></a> and
leaves a surplus divided by the Patel and village register (Patwari).
A cart-load of <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>karbi</em></span> (the stalks of <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>juar</em></span> and <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>bajra</em></span>) is exacted from
every cultivator as fodder for the prince’s cattle; but this is
commuted for a rupee, except in seasons of scarcity, when it is
stored up. The other officers, as the Patwaris and Patels, are
paid out of the respective shares of the farmer and the crown,
namely, one-fourth of a ser each, from every maund of produce,
or an eightieth part of the gross amount. The cultivators of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1116'>1116</span>the Pattawats or feudal chiefs are much better off than those of
the Khalisa: from them only two-fifths are exacted; and in lieu
of all other taxes and charges, a land-tax of twelve rupees is
levied on every hundred bighas of land cultivated. The cultivators
repay this mild assessment by attachment to the chiefs.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Poll Tax.</h4>—Anga is a poll-tax (from <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>anga</em></span>, ‘the body’) of one
rupee, levied on adults of either sex throughout Marwar.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Cattle Tax.</h4>—Ghasmali is a graduated tax on cattle, or, as the
term imports, the right of pasture. A sheep or goat is estimated
at one anna (one-sixteenth of a rupee); a buffalo eight annas,
or half a rupee; and each camel, three rupees.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Door Tax.</h4>—Kewari is a tax on doors (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>kewar</em></span>), and is considered
peculiarly oppressive. It was first imposed by Bijai
Singh, when, towards the latter end of his reign, his chiefs rebelled,
and retired in a body to Pali to concert schemes for deposing
him. Thither he fruitlessly followed in order to pacify them,
and on his return found the gates (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>kewar</em></span>) of his capital shut in
his face, and Bhim Singh placed upon the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>gaddi</em></span>. To supply the
pecuniary exigencies consequent upon this embarrassing situation,
he appealed to his subjects, and proposed a ‘benevolence,’ in aid
of his necessities, of three rupees for each house, giving it a
denomination from the cause whence it originated. Whether
employed as a punishment of those who aided his antagonist, or
as a convenient expedient of finance, he converted this temporary
contribution into a permanent tax, which continued until the
necessities of the confederacy against the [173] present prince,
Raja Man, and the usurpation of the fiscal lands by the Pathans,
made him raise it to ten rupees on each house. It is, however,
not equally levied; the number of houses in each township being
calculated, it is laid on according to the means of the occupants,
and the poor man may pay two rupees, while the wealthy pays
twenty. The feudal lands are not exempted, except in cases of
special favour.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Sāīr.</h4>—In estimating the amount of the sair, or imposts of
Marwar, it must be borne in mind that the schedule appended
represents what they have been, and perhaps might again be,
rather than what they now are. These duties are subject to
fluctuation in all countries, but how much more in those exposed
to so many visitations from predatory foes, civil strife, and
famine! There is no reason to doubt that, in the “good old
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1117'>1117</span>times” of Maru, the amount, as taken from old records, may have
been realized:—</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Military Forces.</h4>—It only remains to state the military resources
of the Rathors, which fluctuate with their revenues.
The Rajas maintain a foreign mercenary force upon their fiscal
revenues to overawe their own turbulent vassalage. These are
chiefly Rohilla and Afghan infantry, armed with muskets and
matchlocks; and having cannon and sufficient discipline to act
in a body, they are formidable to the Rajput cavaliers. Some
years ago, Raja Man had a corps of three thousand five hundred
foot, and fifteen hundred horse, with twenty-five guns, commanded
by Hindal Khan, a native of Panipat. He has been
attached to the family ever since the reign of Bijai Singh, and is
(or was) familiarly addressed <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>kaka</em></span>, or ‘uncle,’ by the prince.
There was also a brigade of those monastic militants, the Bishanswamis,
under their leader, Kaimdas, consisting of seven hundred
foot, three hundred horse, and an establishment of rockets (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>bhan</em></span>),
a very ancient instrument of Indian warfare, and mentioned long
before gunpowder was used in Europe. At one period, the Raja
maintained a foreign force amounting to, or at least mustered as,
eleven thousand men, of which number two thousand five hundred
were cavalry, with fifty-five guns, and a rocket establishment.
Besides a monthly pay, lands to a considerable amount were
granted to the commanders of the different legions. By these
overgrown establishments, to maintain a superiority over the
feudal lords which has been undermined by the causes related,
the demoralization and ruin of this country have been accelerated.
The existence of such a species of force, opposed in moral and
religious sentiment to the retainers of the State, has only tended
to widen the breach between them and their head, and to destroy
every feeling of confidence.</div>

  <h2 class='c005'>BOOK VI <br /> <span class='fss'>ANNALS OF BĪKANER</span></h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c024'>CHAPTER 1</h3>

<p class='c012'>Bikaner holds a secondary rank amongst the principalities of
Rajputana. It is an offset of Marwar, its princes being scions
of the house of Jodha, who established themselves by conquest
on the northern frontier of the parent State; and its position,
in the heart of the desert, has contributed to the maintenance of
their independence.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Rāo Bīka, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1465-1504.</h4>—It was in S. 1515 (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1459), the
year in which Jodha transferred the seat of government from
Mandor to Jodhpur, that his son Bika,<a id='r6.1.1' /><a href='#f6.1.1' class='c013'><sup>[1]</sup></a> under the guidance of his
uncle Kandhal, led three hundred of the sons of Siahji to enlarge
the boundaries of Rathor dominion amidst the sands of Maru.
Bika was stimulated to the attempt by the success of his brother
Bida, who had recently subjugated the territory inhabited by the
Mohils for ages.</div>

<p class='c001'>Such expeditions as that of Bika, undertaken expressly for
conquest, were almost [179] uniformly successful. The invaders
set out with a determination to slay or be slain; and these forays
had the additional stimulus of being on “fated days,” when the
warlike creed of the Rajputs made the abstraction of territory
from foe or friend a matter of religious duty.</p>

<p class='c001'>Bika, with his band of three hundred, fell upon the Sankhlas<a id='r6.1.2' /><a href='#f6.1.2' class='c013'><sup>[2]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1124'>1124</span>of Janglu, whom they massacred. This exploit brought them in
contact with the Bhattis of Pugal,<a id='r6.1.3' /><a href='#f6.1.3' class='c013'><sup>[3]</sup></a> the chief of which gave his
daughter in marriage to Bika, who fixed his headquarters at
Kuramdesar, where he erected a castle, and gradually augmented
his conquests from the neighbourhood.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Conquest of the Jats.</h4>—Bika now approximated to the
settlements of the Jats or Getae, who had for ages been established
in these arid abodes; and as the lands they held form a considerable
portion of the State of Bikaner, it may not be uninteresting
to give a sketch of the condition of this singular people prior
to the son of Jodha establishing the feudal system of Rajwara
amongst their pastoral commonwealths.</div>

<p class='c001'>Of this celebrated and widely spread race we have already
given a succinct account.<a id='r6.1.4' /><a href='#f6.1.4' class='c013'><sup>[4]</sup></a> It appears to have been the most
numerous as well as the most conspicuous of the tribes of ancient
Asia, from the days of Tomyris and Cyrus to those of the present
Jat prince of Lahore, whose successor, if he be endued with
similar energy, may, on the reflux of population, find himself
seated in their original haunts of Central Asia, to which they have
already considerably advanced.<a id='r6.1.5' /><a href='#f6.1.5' class='c013'><sup>[5]</sup></a> In the fourth century we find
a Yuti or Jat kingdom established in the Panjab;<a id='r6.1.6' /><a href='#f6.1.6' class='c013'><sup>[6]</sup></a> but how
much earlier this people colonized those regions we are ignorant.
At every step made by Muhammadan power in India it encountered
the Jats. On their memorable defence of the passage
of the Indus against Mahmud, and on the war of extirpation
waged against them by Timur, both in their primeval seats in
Mawaru-l-nahr,<a id='r6.1.7' /><a href='#f6.1.7' class='c013'><sup>[7]</sup></a> as well as east of the Sutlej, we have already
enlarged; while Babur, in his Commentaries, informs us that,
in all his irruptions into India, he was assailed by multitudes of
Jats<a id='r6.1.8' /><a href='#f6.1.8' class='c013'><sup>[8]</sup></a> during his progress through the Panjab, the peasantry of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1125'>1125</span>which region, now proselytes to Islam, are chiefly of this tribe;
as well as the [180] military retainers, who, as sectarian followers
of Nanak, merge the name of Jat, or Jāt, into that of Sikh or
‘disciple.’<a id='r6.1.9' /><a href='#f6.1.9' class='c013'><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In short, whether as Yuti, Getae, Jats, Juts, or Jāts, this race
far surpassed in numbers, three centuries ago, any other tribe or
race in India; and it is a fact that they now constitute a vast
majority of the peasantry of western Rajwara, and perhaps of
northern India.</p>

<p class='c001'>At what period these Jats established themselves in the Indian
desert, we are, as has been already observed, entirely ignorant;
but even at the time of the Rathor invasion of these communities
their habits confirmed the tradition of their Scythic origin.
They led chiefly a pastoral life, were guided, but not governed
by the elders, and with the exception of adoration to the ‘universal
mother’ (Bhavani), incarnate in the person of a youthful
Jatni, they were utter aliens to the Hindu theocracy. In fact,
the doctrines of the great Islamite saint, Shaikh Farid,<a id='r6.1.10' /><a href='#f6.1.10' class='c013'><sup>[10]</sup></a> appear to
have overturned the pagan rites brought from the Jaxartes; and
without any settled ideas on religion, the Jats of the desert
jumbled all their tenets together. They considered themselves,
in short, as a distinct class, and, as a Punia Jat informed me,
“their <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>watan</em></span> was far beyond the Five Rivers.” Even in the
name of one of the six communities (the Asaich), on whose submission
Bika founded his new State, we have nearly the Asi, the
chief of the four tribes from the Oxus and Jaxartes, who overturned
the Greek kingdom of Bactria.<a id='r6.1.11' /><a href='#f6.1.11' class='c013'><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1126'>1126</span>The period of Rathor domination over these patriarchal communities
was intermediate between Timur’s and Babur’s invasion
of India. The former, who was the founder of the Chagatai
dynasty, boasts of the myriads of Jat souls he “consigned to
perdition” on the desert plains of India, as well as in Transoxiana;
so we may conclude that successive migrations of this people
from the great “storehouse of nations” went to the lands east
of the Indus, and that the communities who elected Bika as their
sovereign had been established therein for ages. The extent of
their possessions justifies this conclusion; for nearly the whole
of the territory forming the boundaries of Bikaner was possessed
by the six Jat cantons, namely—</p>

  <ul  class='ul_2'>
    <li>1. Punia.
    </li>
    <li>2. Godara.
    </li>
    <li>3. Saharan.
    </li>
    <li>4. Asaich.
    </li>
    <li>5. Beniwal [or Bhanniwal].
    </li>
    <li>6. Johya, or Joiya [181].
    </li>
  </ul>

<p class='c001'>though this last is by some termed a ramification of the Yadu-Bhatti:
an affiliation by no means invalidating their claims to be
considered of Jat or Yuti origin.<a id='r6.1.12' /><a href='#f6.1.12' class='c013'><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Each canton bore the name of the community, and was subdivided
into districts. Besides the six Jat cantons, there were
three more simultaneously wrested from Rajput proprietors;
namely, Bagor, the Kharipatta, and Mohila. The six Jat cantons
constituted the central and northern, while those of the Rajputs
formed the western and southern frontiers.</p>

<p class='c015'>With such rapidity were States formed in those times, that
in a few years after Bika left his paternal roof at Mandor he was
lord over 2670 villages, and by a title far stronger and more
legitimate than that of conquest—the spontaneous election of
the cantons. But although three centuries have scarcely passed
since their amalgamation [182] into a sovereignty, one-half of
the villages cease to exist; nor are there now 1300 forming the
<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>raj</em></span> of Surat Singh, the present occupant and lineal descendant
of Bika.<a id='r6.1.13' /><a href='#f6.1.13' class='c013'><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The Jats and Johyas of these regions, who extended over all
the northern desert even to the Gara, led a pastoral life, their
wealth consisting in their cattle, which they reared in great
numbers, disposing of the superfluity, and of the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>ghi</em></span> (butter
clarified) and wool, through the medium of Sarsot (Sarasvati)
Brahmans (who, in these regions, devote themselves to traffic),
receiving in return grain and other conveniences or necessaries
of life.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Bīda conquers the Mohil Clan.</h4>—A variety of causes conspired
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1128'>1128</span>to facilitate the formation of the State of Bikaner, and the reduction
of the ancient Scythic simplicity of the Jat communities to
Rajput feudal sway; and although the success of his brother
Bida over the Mohils in some degree paved the way, his bloodless
conquest could never have happened but for the presence of a
vice which has dissolved all the republics of the world. The
jealousy of the Johyas and Godaras, the two most powerful of
the six Jat cantons, was the immediate motive to the propitiation
of the “son of Jodha”; besides which, the communities
found the band of Bida, which had extirpated the ancient Mohils
when living with them in amity, most troublesome neighbours.
Further, they were desirous to place between them and the
Bhattis of Jaisalmer a more powerful barrier; and last, not least,
they dreaded the hot valour and “thirst for land” which characterized
Bika’s retainers, now contiguous to them at Janglu.
For these weighty reasons, at a meeting of the “elders” of the
Godaras, it was resolved to conciliate the Rathor.</div>

<p class='c001'>Pandu was the patriarchal head of the Godaras; his residence
was at Shaikhsar.<a id='r6.1.14' /><a href='#f6.1.14' class='c013'><sup>[14]</sup></a> The ‘elder’ of Ronia was next in rank and
estimation to Pandu, in communities where equality was as
absolute as the proprietary right to the lands which each individually
held: that of pasture being common.</p>

<p class='c001'>The elders of Shaikhsar and Ronia were deputed to enter
into terms with the Rajput prince, and to invest him with
supremacy over their community, on the following conditions:—</p>

<p class='c001'><em>First.</em> To make common cause with them, against the Johyas
and other cantons, with whom they were then at variance.</p>

<p class='c001'><em>Second.</em> To guard the western frontier against the irruption
of the Bhattis [183].</p>

<p class='c001'><em>Third.</em> To hold the rights and privileges of the community
inviolable.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the fulfilment of these conditions they relinquished to
Bika and his descendants the supreme power over the Godaras;
assigning to him, in perpetuity, the power to levy <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>dhuan</em></span>, or a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1129'>1129</span>‘hearth tax,’ of one rupee on each house in the canton, and a
land tax of two rupees on each hundred bighas of cultivated
land within their limits.</p>

<p class='c001'>Apprehensive, however, that Bika or his descendants might
encroach upon their rights, they asked what security he could
offer against such a contingency? The Rajput chief replied
that, in order to dissipate their fears on this head, as well as to
perpetuate the remembrance of the supremacy thus voluntarily
conferred, he would solemnly bind himself and his successors to
receive the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>tika</em></span> of inauguration from the hands of the descendants
of the elders of Shaikhsar and Ronia, and that the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>gaddi</em></span> should
be deemed vacant until such rite was administered.</p>

<p class='c001'>In this simple transfer of the allegiance of this pastoral people
we mark that instinctive love of liberty which accompanied the
Getae in all places and all conditions of society, whether on the
banks of the Oxus and the Jaxartes, or in the sandy desert of
India; and although his political independence is now annihilated,
he is still ready even to shed his blood if his Rajput master
dare to infringe his inalienable right to his <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>bapota</em></span>, his paternal
acres.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Former Owners conferring Titles on their Successors.</h4>—It is
seldom that so incontestable a title to supremacy can be asserted
as that which the weakness and jealousies of the Godaras conferred
upon Bika, and it is a pleasing incident to find almost
throughout India, in the observance of certain rites, the remembrance
of the original compact which transferred the sovereign
power from the lords of the soil to their Rajput conquerors.
Thus, in Mewar, the fact of the power conferred upon the Guhilot
founder by the Bhil aborigines is commemorated by a custom
brought down to the present times. (See Vol. I. p. <a href='http://www.gutenberg.org/files/57374/57374-h/57374-h.htm#Page_262'>262</a>.) At
Amber the same is recorded in the important offices retained by
the Minas, the primitive inhabitants of that land. Both Kotah
and Bundi retain in their names the remembrance of the ancient
lords of Haraoti; and Bika’s descendants preserve, in a twofold
manner, the recollection of their bloodless conquest of the Jats.
To this day the descendant of Pandu applies the unguent of
royalty to the forehead of the successors of Bika; on which
occasion the prince places ‘the fine of relief,’ consisting of twenty-five
pieces of gold, in the hand of the Jat. Moreover, the spot
which he selected for his capital was the birthright of a Jat, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1130'>1130</span>would only concede it for this purpose on the condition that his
name should be linked in perpetuity with its surrender. Naira,
or Nera [184], was the name of the proprietor, which Bika added
to his own, thus composing that of the future capital, Bikaner.<a id='r6.1.15' /><a href='#f6.1.15' class='c013'><sup>[15]</sup></a></div>

<p class='c001'>Besides this periodical recognition of the transfer of power,
on all lapses of the crown, there are annual memorials of the
rights of the Godaras, acknowledged not only by the prince, but
by all his Rajput vassal-kin, quartered on the lands of the Jat;
and although ‘the sons of Bika,’ now multiplied over the country,
do not much respect the ancient compact, they at least recognize,
in the maintenance of these formulae, the origin of their power.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the spring and autumnal<a id='r6.1.16' /><a href='#f6.1.16' class='c013'><sup>[16]</sup></a> festivals of the Holi and Diwali,
the heirs of the patriarchs of Shaikhsar and Ronia give the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>tika</em></span>
to the prince and all his feudality. The Jat of Ronia bears the
silver cup and platter which holds the ampoule of the desert,
while his compeer applies it to the prince’s forehead. The Raja
in return deposits a <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>nazarana</em></span> of a gold mohur, and five pieces of
silver; the chieftains, according to their rank, following his
example. The gold is taken by the Shaikhsar Jat, the silver by
the elder of Ronia.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Conquest of the Johya Tribe.</h4>—To resume our narrative: when
the preliminaries were adjusted, by Bika’s swearing to maintain
the rights of the community which thus surrendered their liberties
to his keeping, they united their arms, and invaded the Johyas.
This populous community, which extended over the northern
region of the desert, even to the Sutlej, reckoned eleven hundred
villages in their canton; yet now, after the lapse of little more
than three centuries, the very name of Johya is extinct. They
appear to be the Janjuha of Babur, who, in his irruption into
India, found them congregated with the Juds, about the cluster
of hills in the first <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>duaba</em></span> of the Panjab, called ‘the mountains
of Jud’; a position claimed by the Yadus or Jadons in the
very dawn of their history, and called Jadu ka dang, ‘the Jadu
hills.’<a id='r6.1.17' /><a href='#f6.1.17' class='c013'><sup>[17]</sup></a> This supports the assertion that the Johya is of Yadu
race, while it does not invalidate its claims to Yuti or Jat descent,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1131'>1131</span>as will be further shown in the early portion of the annals of the
Yadu-Bhattis.<a id='r6.1.18' /><a href='#f6.1.18' class='c013'><sup>[18]</sup></a></div>

<p class='c001'>The patriarchal head of the Johyas resided at Bharopal;<a id='r6.1.19' /><a href='#f6.1.19' class='c013'><sup>[19]</sup></a>
his name was Sher Singh [185]. He mustered the strength of
the canton, and for a long time withstood the continued efforts
of the Rajputs and the Godaras; nor was it until “treason had
done its worst,” by the murder of their elder, and the consequent
possession of Bharopal, that the Johyas succumbed to Rathor
domination.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Foundation of Bīkaner, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1455-88.</h4>—With this accession of
power, Bika carried his arms westward and conquered Bagor
from the Bhattis. It was in this district, originally wrested by
the Bhattis from the Jats, that Bika founded his capital, Bikaner,
on the 15th Baisakh, S. 1545 (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1489), thirty years after his
departure from the parental roof at Mandor.</div>

<p class='c001'>When Bika was thus firmly established, his uncle Kandhal,
to whose spirit of enterprise he was mainly indebted for success,
departed with his immediate kin to the northward, with a view
of settling in fresh conquests. He successively subjugated the
communities of Asaich, Beniwal, and Saran, which cantons are
mostly occupied by his descendants, styled Kandhalot Rathors,
at this day, and although they form an integral portion of the
Bikaner State, they evince, in their independent bearing to its
chief, that their estates were “the gift of their own swords, not
of his patents”; and they pay but a reluctant and nominal
obedience to his authority. When necessity or avarice imposes
a demand for tribute, it is often met by a flat refusal, accompanied
with such a comment as this: “Who made this Raja? Was it
not our common ancestor, Kandhal? Who is he, who presumes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1132'>1132</span>to levy tribute from us?” Kandhal’s career of conquest was cut
short by the emperor’s lieutenant in Hissar; he was slain in
attempting this important fortress.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Death of Bīka. Nūnkaran or Lūnkaran, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1504-26.</h4>—Bika
died in S. 1551 (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1495), leaving two sons by the daughter of
the Bhatti chief of Pugal, namely, Nunkaran, who succeeded,
and Garsi, who founded Garsisar and Arsisar. The stock of the
latter is numerous, and is distinguished by the epithet Garsot
Bika, whose principal fiefs are those of Garsisar and Gharibdesar,
each having twenty-four villages depending on them.<a id='r6.1.20' /><a href='#f6.1.20' class='c013'><sup>[20]</sup></a></div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Jeth Singh, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1526-41.</h4>—Nunkaran made several conquests
from the Bhattis, on the western frontier. He had four sons; his
eldest desiring a separate establishment in his lifetime, for the
fief of Mahajan and one hundred and forty villages, renounced
his right of primogeniture in favour of his brother Jeth, who
succeeded in S. 1569. His brothers had each appanages assigned
to them. He had three sons: (1) Kalyan Singh, (2) Siahji, and (3)
Aishpal [186]. Jethsi reduced the district of Narnot from some
independent Girasia chiefs, and settled it as the appanage of his
second son, Siahji. It was Jethsi also who compelled ‘the sons
of Bida,’ the first Rathor colonists of this region, to acknowledge
his supremacy by an annual tribute, besides certain taxes.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Kalyān Singh, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1541-71.</h4>—Kalyan Singh succeeded in S.
1603. He had three sons: (1) Rae Singh, (2) Ram Singh, and
(3) Prithi Singh.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Rāē Singh, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1571-1611. Bīkaner subject to the Mughals.
Akbar’s Marriage.</h4>—Rae Singh succeeded in S. 1630 (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1573).
Until this reign the Jats had, in a great degree, preserved their
ancient privileges. Their maintenance was, however, found
rather inconvenient by the now superabundant Rajput population,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1133'>1133</span>and they were consequently dispossessed of all political
authority. With the loss of independence their military spirit
decayed, and they sunk into mere tillers of the earth. In this
reign also Bikaner rose to importance amongst the principalities
of the empire, and if the Jats parted with their liberties to the
Rajput, the latter, in like manner, bartered his freedom to become
a Satrap of Delhi. On his father’s death, Rae Singh in person
undertook the sacred duty of conveying his ashes to the Ganges.
The illustrious Akbar was then emperor of India. Rae Singh
and the emperor had married sisters, princesses of Jaisalmer.<a id='r6.1.21' /><a href='#f6.1.21' class='c013'><sup>[21]</sup></a>
This connexion obtained for him, on his introduction to court
by Raja Man of Amber, the dignity of a leader of four thousand
horse, the title of Raja, and the government of Hissar. Moreover,
when Maldeo of Jodhpur incurred the displeasure of the
king, and was dispossessed of the rich district of Nagor, it was
given to Rae Singh. With these honours, and increased power
as one of the king’s lieutenants, he returned to his dominions,
and sent his brother Ram Singh against Bhatner,<a id='r6.1.22' /><a href='#f6.1.22' class='c013'><sup>[22]</sup></a> of which he
made a conquest. This town was the chief place of a district
belonging to the Bhattis, originally Jats<a id='r6.1.23' /><a href='#f6.1.23' class='c013'><sup>[23]</sup></a> of Yadu descent, but
who assumed this name on becoming proselytes to the faith of
Islam.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Subjugation of the Johyas.</h4>—Ram Singh at the same time
completely subjugated the Johyas, who, always troublesome,
had recently attempted to regain their ancient independence.
The Rajputs carried fire and sword into this country, of which
they made a desert. Ever since it has remained desolate: the
very name of Johya is lost, though the vestiges of considerable
towns bear testimony to a remote antiquity.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Traditions of Greek Settlements.</h4>—Amidst these ruins of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1134'>1134</span>Johyas, the name of Sikandar Rumi (Alexander the Great) [187]
has fixed itself, and the desert retains the tradition that the ruin
called Rangmahall, the ‘painted palace,’ near Dandusar, was
the capital of a prince of this region punished by a visitation
of the Macedonian conqueror. History affords no evidence of
Alexander’s passage of the Gara, though the scene of his severest
conflict was in that nook of the Panjab not remote from the lands
of the Johyas. But though the chronicler of Alexander does not
sanction our indulging in this speculation, the total darkness in
which we appear doomed to remain with regard to Bactria and
the petty Grecian kingdoms on the Indus, established by him,
does not forbid our surmise, that by some of these, perhaps the
descendants of Python, such a visitation might have happened.<a id='r6.1.24' /><a href='#f6.1.24' class='c013'><sup>[24]</sup></a>
The same traditions assert that these regions were not always
either arid or desolate, and the living chronicle alluded to in
the note repeated the stanza elsewhere given, which dated its
deterioration from the drying up of the Hakra river, which came
from the Panjab, and flowing through the heart of this country,
emptied itself into the Indus between Rohri Bhakkar and Uchh.</div>

<p class='c001'>The affinity that this word (Hakra) has both to the Ghaggar,
and Sankra,<a id='r6.1.25' /><a href='#f6.1.25' class='c013'><sup>[25]</sup></a> would lead to the conclusion of either being the
stream referred to. The former we know as being engulphed in
the sands about the Hariana confines, while the Sankra is a
stream which, though now dry, was used as a line of demarcation
even in the time of Nadir Shah. It ran eastward, parallel with
the Indus, and by making it his boundary, Nadir added all the
fertile valley of the Indus to his Persian kingdom. (See map.)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1135'>1135</span>The only date this legendary stanza assigns for the catastrophe
is the reign of the Sodha prince, Hamir.</p>

<p class='c001'>Ram Singh, having thus destroyed the power of future resistance
in the Johyas, turned his arms against the Punia Jats, the
last who preserved their ancient liberty. They were vanquished,
and the Rajputs were inducted into their most valuable possessions.
But the conqueror paid the penalty of his life for the
glory of colonizing the lands of the Punias. He was slain in their
expiring effort to shake off the yoke of the stranger; and though
the Ramsinghgots add to the numerical strength, and enlarge the
territory of the heirs of Bika, they, like the Kandhalots, little
increase the power [188] of the State, to which their obedience
is nominal. Sidmukh and Sanku are the two chief places of the
Ramsinghgots.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus, with the subjugation of the Punias, the political annihilation
of the six Jat cantons of the desert was accomplished: they
are now occupied in agriculture and their old pastoral pursuits,
and are an industrious tax-paying race under their indolent
Rajput masters.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Rāē Singh in Akbar’s Service.</h4>—Raja Rae Singh led a gallant
band of his Rathors in all the wars of Akbar. He was distinguished
in the assault of Ahmadabad, slaying in single combat
the governor, Mirza Muhammad Husain.<a id='r6.1.26' /><a href='#f6.1.26' class='c013'><sup>[26]</sup></a> The emperor, who
knew the value of such valorous subjects, strengthened the
connexion which already subsisted between the crown and the
Rathors, by obtaining for prince Salim (afterwards Jahangir)
Rae Singh’s daughter to wife. The unfortunate Parvez was the
fruit of this marriage.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Karan Singh, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1631-69.</h4>—Rae Singh was succeeded by his
only son, Karan, in S. 1688 (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1632).<a id='r6.1.27' /><a href='#f6.1.27' class='c013'><sup>[27]</sup></a></div>

<p class='c001'>Karan held the ‘mansab of two thousand,’ and the government
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1136'>1136</span>of Daulatabad, in his father’s lifetime. Being a supporter
of the just claims of Dara Shukoh, a plot was laid by the general
of his antagonist, with whom he served, to destroy him, but which
he was enabled to defeat by the timely intelligence of the Hara
prince of Bundi. He died at Bikaner, leaving four sons: (1)
Padma Singh, (2) Kesari Singh, (3) Mohan Singh, and (4) Anup
Singh.</p>

<p class='c001'>This family furnishes another example of the prodigal sacrifice
of Rajput blood in the imperial service. The two elder princes
were slain in the storm of Bijapur, and the tragical death of the
third, Mohan Singh, in the imperial camp, forms an episode in
<cite>Ferishta’s History of the Dekhan</cite> [189].<a id='r6.1.28' /><a href='#f6.1.28' class='c013'><sup>[28]</sup></a></p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Anūp Singh, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1669-98.</h4>—Anup Singh succeeded in S. 1730
(<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1674). For the services of his family he had the castle and
lands of Adoni<a id='r6.1.29' /><a href='#f6.1.29' class='c013'><sup>[29]</sup></a> conferred upon him, with ‘the mansab of five
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1137'>1137</span>thousand,’ and the governments of Bijapur and Aurangabad.
Anup Singh led his clans with the head of his race, the prince of
Jodhpur, to quell a rebellion amongst the Afghans of Kabul,
which having effected, he returned to the peninsula. Ferishta
and the native annals are at variance on his death; the former
asserting that he died in the Deccan, while the latter say that
he left that country, disgusted with the imperial commander’s
interference about his ground of encampment, and that he died
at Bikaner.<a id='r6.1.30' /><a href='#f6.1.30' class='c013'><sup>[30]</sup></a> He left two sons, Sarup Singh and Sujan Singh.</div>

S. 1793 (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1737). The domestic incidents of this, as of the
preceding reigns, are without interest.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Gaj Singh, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1745-88.</h4>—Gaj Singh succeeded in S. 1802
(<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1746). Throughout a long reign of forty-one years, this
prince carried on border strife with the Bhattis and the Khan of
Bahawalpur. From the former he took Rajasar, Kela, Raner,
Satasar, Banipura, Mutalai, and other villages of inferior note;
and from the Khan he recovered the important frontier castle of
Anupgarh.</div>

<p class='c001'>He laid waste, filling up the wells, a considerable tract of
country west of the frontier post of Anupgarh, to prevent the
incursions of the Daudputras.<a id='r6.1.32' /><a href='#f6.1.32' class='c013'><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Raja Gaj had some celebrity from the number of his offspring,
having had sixty-one children, though all but six were the ‘sons
of love.’ The legitimates were, Chhattar Singh, who died in
infancy; Raj Singh, who was poisoned by the mother of Surat
Singh, the reigning prince; Surthan Singh and Ajib Singh, both
of whom fled the paternal roof to escape the fate of their elder
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1138'>1138</span>brother, and are now at Jaipur; Surat Singh, Raja of Bikaner;
and Shyam Singh, who enjoys a small appanage in Bikaner.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Rāj Singh, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1788.</h4>—Raj Singh succeeded his father, S.
1843 (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1787), but he enjoyed the dignity only thirteen days,
being removed by a dose of poison by the mother<a id='r6.1.33' /><a href='#f6.1.33' class='c013'><sup>[33]</sup></a> of Surat Singh,
the fifth son of Raja Gaj. The crown thus nefariously obtained,
this worthy son [190] of such a parent determined to maintain his
authority by like means, and to leave no competitor to contest
his claims. He has accordingly removed by death or exile all
who stood between him and the ‘<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>gaddi</em></span> of Bika.’</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Partāp Singh, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1788. Usurpation of Sūrat Singh.</h4>—Raj
Singh left two sons, Partap Singh and Jai Singh. On the death
of Raj Singh, the office of regent, a word of ominous import in
these regions, was assumed by Surat Singh, who, during eighteen
months, conducted himself with great circumspection, and by
condescension and gifts impressed the chiefs in his favour. At
length he broke his plans to the chiefs of Mahajan and Bahaduran,
whose acquiescence in his usurpation he secured by additions
to their estates. The faithful Bakhtawar Singh, whose family
during four generations had filled the office of Diwan, discovered
the scheme, though too late to counteract it, and the attempt
was punished by imprisonment. Prepared for the last step, the
regent collected foreign troops from Bhatinda<a id='r6.1.34' /><a href='#f6.1.34' class='c013'><sup>[34]</sup></a> and other parts,
sufficient to overcome all opposition. The infant prince was
kept secluded, and at length the regent issued the warrant in his
own name for the nobles to assemble at the capital. Except the
two traitors enumerated, they to a man refused; but instead of
combining to oppose him, they indolently remained at their
castles. Collecting all his troops, the usurper passed to Nohar,
where he enticed the chief of Bhukarka to an interview, and
lodged him in the fortress of Nohar.<a id='r6.1.35' /><a href='#f6.1.35' class='c013'><sup>[35]</sup></a> Thence he passed to
Ajitpura, which he plundered; and advancing to Sankhu, he
attacked it in form. Durjan Singh defended himself with valour,
and when reduced to extremity, committed suicide. His heir
was put in fetters, and a fine of twelve thousand rupees was
levied from the vassals of Sankhu. The commercial town of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1139'>1139</span>Churu was next attacked; it held out six months, when the
confined chief of Bhukarka, as the price of his own freedom,
treacherously offered to put the tyrant in possession. He effected
this, and a fine of nearly two lakhs of rupees (£20,000) was offered
to spare the town from plunder.</div>

<p class='c001'>By this act of severity, and the means it furnished, Surat
returned to Bikaner, determined to remove the only bar between
him and the crown, his prince and nephew. In this he found
some difficulty, from the virtue and vigilance of his sister, who
never lost sight of the infant. Frustrated in all attempts to
circumvent her, and not daring to blazon the murder by open
violence, he invited the needy Raja of Narwar to make proposals
for his sister’s hand. In vain she urged her advanced period of
life; and in order to deter the suitor, that she had already been
affianced to Rana Arsi of Mewar. All his scruples vanished at
the dower of three lakhs, which the regent offered [191] the
impoverished scion of the famous Raja Nala.<a id='r6.1.36' /><a href='#f6.1.36' class='c013'><sup>[36]</sup></a> Her objections
were overruled and she was forced to submit; though she not
only saw through her brother’s anxiety for her removal, but
boldly charged him with his nefarious intentions. He was not
content with disavowing them, but at her desire gave her the
most solemn assurances of the child’s safety. Her departure was
the signal of his death; for not long after he was found strangled,
and it is said by the regent’s own hands, having in vain
endeavoured to obtain the offices of the Mahajan chieftain as the
executioner of his sovereign.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Sūrat Singh, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1788-1828.</h4>—Thus, in one short year after
the death of Raja Raj, the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>gaddi</em></span> of Bika was dishonoured by
being possessed by an assassin of his prince. In S. 1857 (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span>
1801), the elder brothers of the usurper, Surthan Singh and Ajib
Singh, who had found refuge in Jaipur, repaired to Bhatner and
assembled the vassals of the disaffected nobles and Bhattis in
order to dethrone the tyrant. But the recollection of his severities
deterred some, while bribes kept back others, and the usurper
did not hesitate to advance to meet his foes. The encounter,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1140'>1140</span>which took place at Bigor, was obstinate and bloody, and three
thousand Bhattis alone fell. This signal victory confirmed
Surat’s usurpation. He erected a castle on the field of battle,
which he called Fatehgarh, ‘the fort of victory.’</div>

<p class='c001'>Flushed with this brilliant success, Surat Singh determined
to make his authority respected both at home and abroad. He
invaded his turbulent countrymen, the Bidawats, and levied
fifty thousand rupees from their lands. Churu,<a id='r6.1.37' /><a href='#f6.1.37' class='c013'><sup>[37]</sup></a> which had
promised aid to the late confederacy, was once more invested and
mulcted, and various other places were attacked ere they could
join. But one solitary castle was successfully defended, that of
Chhani, near Bahaduran. Here the usurper was foiled, and,
after six months’ fruitless siege, compelled to return to his capital.</p>

<p class='c001'>Shortly after, he eagerly availed himself of an opportunity to
punish the excesses of the Daudputras, and to withdraw attention
from himself, by kindling a popular war against these powerful
and turbulent neighbours. The occasion was the Kirani chief of
Tirhara demanding his aid against his liege lord, Bahawal Khan.
As these border feuds are not extinguished even in these days of
universal peace, it may not be uninteresting to see the feudal
muster-roll of the desert chiefs on such occurrences, as well as the
mode in which they carry on hostilities. It was very shortly
before that victory had preponderated on the side of the Rathors
by a gallant <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>coup-de-main</em></span> of [192] the lord marcher of Bikaner,
who carried the castle of Mozgarh<a id='r6.1.38' /><a href='#f6.1.38' class='c013'><sup>[38]</sup></a> in a midnight assault. The
hero on this occasion was not a Rathor, but a Bhatti chief, in the
service of Bikaner, named Hindu Singh, who gained ‘immortality’
by the style in which he scaled the walls, put Muhammad Maaruf
Kirani, the governor, and the garrison to the sword, and brought
away captive to Bikaner the governor’s wife, who was afterwards
ransomed for five thousand rupees and four hundred camels.</p>

<p class='c001'>The outlaw who sought <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>saran</em></span> at Bikaner, on this occasion, was
of the same tribe, Kirani, his name Khudabakhsh (‘gift of God’),
chief of Tirhara, one of the principal fiefs of the Daudputras.
With all his retainers, to the amount of three hundred horse and
five hundred foot, he threw himself on the protection of Surat
Singh, who assigned him twenty villages, and one hundred rupees
daily for his support. The Kiranis were the most powerful vassals
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1141'>1141</span>of Bahawal Khan, who might have paid dear for the resumption
of Tirhara, whose chief promised the Rajput nothing less than to
extend his conquests to the Indus. Allured by this bait, the Kher
was proclaimed and the sons of Bika assembled from all quarters.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Attack on Bahāwalpur.</h4>—The command-in-chief of this brilliant
array was conferred on Jethra Mahto, son of the Diwan. On the
13th of Magh 1856 (spring of 1800) he broke ground, and the
feudal levies fell in on the march by Kanasar, Rajasar, Keli,
Raner, and Anupgarh, the last point of rendezvous. Thence he
proceeded by Sheogarh,<a id='r6.1.39' /><a href='#f6.1.39' class='c013'><sup>[39]</sup></a> Mozgarh, and Phulra, all of which were
taken after a few weeks’ siege, and from the last they levied a
lakh and a quarter of rupees, with other valuables, and nine
guns. They advanced to Khairpur,<a id='r6.1.40' /><a href='#f6.1.40' class='c013'><sup>[40]</sup></a> within three miles of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1142'>1142</span>Indus, when being joined by other refractory chiefs, Jethra
marched direct on the capital, Bahawalpur, within a short
distance of which he encamped preparatory to the attack. The
Khan, however, by this delay, was enabled to detach the most
considerable of his nobles from the Rajput standard: on which
the Bikaner Diwan, satisfied with the honour of having insulted
Bahawalpur, retreated with the spoils he had acquired. He was received
by the usurper with contempt, and degraded for not fighting.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Bhatti Invasion of Bīkaner.</h4>—The Bhattis, smarting with the
recollection of their degradation, two years after the battle of
Bigor attempted the invasion of Bikaner, but were again repulsed
with loss; and these skirmishes continued until S. 1861 (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span>
1805), when Raja Surat attacked the Khan of the Bhattis in his
capital, Bhatner. It capitulated after a siege of six months,
when Zabita Khan, with his garrison and effects, was permitted
to retire to Rania, since which this place has remained
an appanage of Bikaner.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Attack on Jodhpur.</h4>—The coalition against Jodhpur was
ruinous to Surat, who supported the cause of the pretender, on
which the usurper expended twenty-four lakhs of rupees, nearly
five years’ revenue of this desert region. On this occasion, he
led all his troops in person against Jodhpur, and united in the
siege, which they were however compelled to abandon with
dishonour, and retrograde to their several abodes. In consequence
of this, the usurper fell sick, and was at the last
extremity; nay, the ceremonies for the dead were actually
commenced; but he recovered, to the grief and misery of his
subjects. To supply an exhausted treasury, his extortions know
no bounds; and having cherished the idea that he might compound
his past sins by rites and gifts to the priests, he is surrounded
by a group of avaricious Brahmans, who are maintained in
luxury at the expense of his subjects. His cruelty keeps pace with
his avarice and his fears. The chief of Bhukarka he put to death,
notwithstanding his numerous services. Nahar Singh of Sidmukh,
Gyan Singh and Guman Singh of Gandeli, amongst the chief [194]
feudatories of the State, shared the same fate. Churu was invested
a third time, and with its chief, fell into the tyrant’s hands.</div>

<p class='c001'>With this system of terror, his increasing superstition, and
diminished attention to public duties, the country is annually
deteriorating in population and wealth; and as if they had not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1143'>1143</span>misery enough within, they have not had a single good season for
years.<a id='r6.1.41' /><a href='#f6.1.41' class='c013'><sup>[41]</sup></a> Owing to the disobedience of the northern chiefs, and
the continual incursions of the Rahats, or ‘Bhatti robbers,’ who
sweep the land of cattle, and often cut and carry off entire crops,
the peasant Jat, the ancient lord of the soil, is often left to the
alternative of starvation or emigration. Many have consequently
sought shelter in the British frontier territories, in Hansi and
Hariana, where they are kindly received. Since the English have
occupied Sirsa and the lands belonging to the Bhatti Bahadur
Khan, the misfortunes of the cultivators of the northern parts of
Bikaner have been doubled by the inroads of a band left without
resource. In some parts, the Jats combine to protect themselves
against these inroads: every hamlet has its post of defence, a
tower of earth, on which is perched a watchman and kettledrum,
to beat the alarm, which is taken up from village to village, and
when an enemy is discovered, all are in arms to defend their
property. The unfortunate Jat is obliged to plough his fields
under the load of shield and <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>sang</em></span>, or heavy iron lance; so that,
at no distant period, the whole of this region must become as
desolate as the tracts once possessed by the Johyas.<a id='r6.1.42' /><a href='#f6.1.42' class='c013'><sup>[42]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Such, at the end of three hundred and twenty-three years, is
the change which a Rajput usurper has effected in the once
comparatively populous communities of the Jats. From the
founder, Bika, to the present tyrannical governor, there have
been only eleven descents though thirteen reigns, giving an
average of thirty years for the one, and twenty-five for the other:
a fact which speaks forcibly for the general morality of the
descendants of Bika.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Bīdāvati.</h4>—Before we enter on the physical aspect of the
country, we must make mention of Bidavati, the lands of ‘the
sons of Bida,’ now an integral portion of Bikaner.<a id='r6.1.43' /><a href='#f6.1.43' class='c013'><sup>[43]</sup></a> It will be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1144'>1144</span>borne in mind that Bida, the brother of Bika, led the first Rajput
colony from Mandor, in search of a fresh establishment. His
first attempt was in the province of Godwar, then belonging to
the Rana: but his reception there was so warm, that [195] he
moved northward, and was glad to take service with the chief of
the Mohils. This ancient tribe is by some termed a branch of
the Yadus, but is by others considered a separate race, and one
of the ‘Thirty-six Royal Races’: all are agreed as to its antiquity.
The residence of the Mohil chief was Chhapar,<a id='r6.1.44' /><a href='#f6.1.44' class='c013'><sup>[44]</sup></a> where, with the
title of Thakur, he ruled over one hundred and forty townships.
Bida deemed circumvention better than open force to effect his
purposes; and as, according to the Rajput maxim, in all attempts
‘to obtain land,’ success hallows the means, he put in train a
scheme which, as it affords the least cause for suspicion, has often
been used for this object. Bida became the medium of a matrimonial
arrangement between the Mohil chief and the prince of
Marwar; and as the relation and natural guardian of the bride,
he conveyed the nuptial train unsuspected into the castle of the
Mohils, whose chiefs were assembled to honour the festivities.
But instead of the Rathor fair and her band of maidens, the
valorous sons of Jodha rushed sword in hand from the litters and
covered vehicles, and treacherously cut off the best men of
Mohila. They kept possession of the inner fortress until tidings
of their success brought reinforcements from Jodhpur. For this
aid, Bida assigned to his father Ladnun and its twelve villages,
now incorporated with Jodhpur. The son of Bida, Tej Singh,
laid the foundation of a new capital, which he called after his
father, Bidesar.<a id='r6.1.45' /><a href='#f6.1.45' class='c013'><sup>[45]</sup></a> The community of the Bidawats is the most
powerful in Bikaner, whose prince is obliged to be satisfied with
almost nominal marks of supremacy, and to restrict his demands,
which are elsewhere unlimited. The little region of the Mohilas,
around the ancient capital Chhapar, is an extensive flat, flooded
in the periodical rains from the surrounding <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>tibas</em></span> or ‘sandhills,’
the soil of which is excellent, even wheat being abundantly produced.
This Oasis, as it is entitled to be termed, may be twenty-five
miles (twelve cos) in extreme length, by about six in breadth.
We cannot affirm that the entire Bidawat district of one hundred
and forty villages, and to which is assigned a population of forty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1145'>1145</span>thousand to fifty thousand souls, one-third being Rathors, ‘the
sons of Bida,’ is within this flat. It is subdivided into twelve
fiefs, of which five are pre-eminent. Of the ancient possessors,
the indigenous Mohils, there are not more than twenty families
throughout the land of Mohila; the rest are chiefly Jat agriculturists
and the mercantile castes.</div>

<p class='c001'>We do the sons of Bida no injustice when we style them a
community of plunderers. Like the sons of Esau, “their hand
is against every man”: and they are too powerful to fear retaliation.
In former times they used to unite with the Larkhanis [196],
another horde of robbers, and carry their raids into the most
populous parts of Jaipur. In these habits, however, they only
partake of the character common to all who inhabit desert
regions. What nature has denied them, they wrest from those
to whom she has been more bountiful. But it is to the absence
of good government more than to natural sterility that we must
attribute the moral obliquity of the Rajaputras, ‘the offspring
of regality,’ spread over these extensive regions, who little discriminate
between <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>meum</em></span> and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>tuum</em></span>, in all that refers to their

of these had given a striking instance of independence in support of the

set aside on appeal, through favouritism, he abjured every future call as an
arbitrator. He was not a wealthy man, but such was the homage paid to
his integrity and talents, that the greatest despot in India found it politic
to reassemble the court, have the case reconsidered, and permit justice to

chieftain, like all his tribe, would find matter for quarrel in the wind blowing
in his face. Having received what he deemed an insult from the brother-in-law
of the Shahzada, in a dispute regarding a fawn, he appealed to his
sword, and a duel ensued even in the presence-chamber, in which young
Mohan fell. The fracas was reported to his brother Padma, at no distance
from the scene. With the few retainers at hand, he rushed to the spot, and
found his brother bathed in his blood. His antagonist, still hanging over
his victim, when he saw the infuriated Rathor enter, with sword and shield,
prepared for dreadful vengeance, retreated behind one of the columns of the
Āmm Khass (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>Divan</em></span>). But Padma’s sword reached him, and avenged his
brother’s death; as the record says, “he felled him to the earth, cleaving
at the same place the pillar in twain.” Taking up the dead body of his
brother, and surrounded by his vassals, he repaired to his quarters, where
he assembled all the Rajput princes serving with their contingents, as
Jaipur, Jodhpur, Haraoti, and harangued them on the insult to their race
in the murder of his brother. They all agreed to abandon the king’s army,
and retire to their own homes. A noble was sent to expostulate by Prince
Muazzam; but in vain. He urged that the prince not only forgave, but
approved the summary vengeance taken by the Rathor; they refused to
listen, and in a body had retired more than twenty miles, when the prince in
person joined them, and concessions and expostulations overcoming them,
they returned to the camp. It was subsequent to this that the two elder
brothers were slain. It is recorded of the surviving brother, that he slew
an enormous lion in single combat. For this exploit, which thoroughly
entitled him to the name he bore (Kesari), ‘the Lion,’ he received an estate
of twenty-five villages from the king. He also obtained great renown for
slaying a Habshi or Abyssinian chief, who commanded for one of the southern
princes.</p>

<h3 class='c024'>CHAPTER 2</h3>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Geography of Bīkaner.</h4>—This region is but little known to
Europeans, by whom it has hitherto been supposed to be a perfect
desert, unworthy of examination. Its present condition bears
little comparison with what tradition reports it to have been in
ancient times; and its deterioration, within three centuries since
the Rajputs supplanted the Jats, almost warrants our belief of
the assertion, that these deserts were once fertile and populous;
nay, that they are still capable (notwithstanding the reported
continual increase of the sand) to maintain an abundant population,
there is little room to doubt. The princes of Bikaner used
to take the field at the head of ten thousand of their kindred
retainers; and although they held extraordinary grants from
the empire for the maintenance of these contingents, their ability
to do so from their proper resources was undoubted. To other
causes than positive sterility must be attributed the wretched
condition of this State. Exposed to the continual attacks of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1146'>1146</span>organized bands of robbers from without, subjected internally
to the never-ending demands of a rapacious government, for
which they have not a shadow of advantage in return, it would
be strange if aught but progressive decay and wretchedness were
the consequence. In three centuries [197], more than one-half
of the villages, which either voluntarily or by force submitted to
the rule of the founder, Bika, are now without memorial of their
existence, and the rest are gradually approximating to the same
condition. Commercial caravans, which passed through this
State and enriched its treasury with the transit duties, have
almost ceased to frequent it from the increasing insecurity of its
territory. Besides the personal loss to the prince the country
suffers from the deterioration of the commercial towns of Churu,
Rajgarh, and Rani, which, as entrepôts, supplied the country
with the productions of Sind and the provinces to the westward,
or those of Gangetic India. Nor is this confined to Bikaner;
the same cause affects Jaisalmer, and the more eastern principalities,
whose misgovernment, equally with Bikaner, fosters the
spirit of rapine: the Maldots of Jaisalmer and the Larkhanis
of Jaipur are as notorious as the Bidawats of Bikaner; and to
these may be added the Sahariyas, Khosas, and Rajars, in the
more western desert, who, in their habits and principles, are as
demoralized as the Bedouins of Arabia.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Extent, Population, Soil, Tibas or Sandhills.</h4>—The line of
greatest breadth of this State extends from Pugal to Rajgarh,
and measures about one hundred and eighty miles; while the
length from north to south, between Bhatner and Mahajan, is
about one hundred and sixty miles: the area may not exceed
twenty-two thousand miles.<a id='r6.2.1' /><a href='#f6.2.1' class='c013'><sup>[1]</sup></a> Formerly they reckoned two
thousand seven hundred towns, villages, and hamlets scattered
over this space, one-half of which are no longer in existence.</div>

without presenting some data, would be very unsatisfactory.
The tract to the north-west of Jethpur is now perfectly desolate,
and nearly so from that point to Bhatner: to the north-east the
population is but scanty, which observation also applies to the
parts from the meridian of Bikaner to the Jaisalmer frontier;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1147'>1147</span>while internally, from these points, it is more uniform, and equals
the northern parts of Marwar. From a census of the twelve
principal towns, with an estimate, furnished by well-informed
inhabitants, of the remainder, we may obtain a tolerably accurate
approximation on this point:</div>

<p class='c001'>Allowing five souls to each house, we have a total of 539,250
souls, giving an average of twenty-five to the square mile, which
I cannot think exaggerated, and making the desert regions
depending on Bikaner equal, in the density of population, the
highlands of Scotland.<a id='r6.2.2' /><a href='#f6.2.2' class='c013'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Of this population, full three-fourths are the aboriginal Jats;
the rest are their conquerors, descendants of Bika, including the
Saraswat Brahmans,<a id='r6.2.3' /><a href='#f6.2.3' class='c013'><sup>[3]</sup></a> Charans, Bards, and a few of the debased
classes, whose numbers, conjointly, are not one-tenth of the
Rajputs.</p>

<div class='section-start'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1148'>1148</span><h4 class='disp-inline'>Jats.</h4>—The Jats are the most wealthy as well as the most
numerous portion of the community. Many of the old Bhumia
landlords, representatives of their ancient communal heads, are
men of substance; but their riches are of no use to them, and to
avoid the rapacity of their government, they cover themselves
with the cloak of poverty, which is thrown aside only on nuptial
festivities. On these occasions they disinter their hoards, which
are lavished with unbounded extravagance. They even block
up the highways to collect visitors, whose numbers form the
measure of the liberality and munificence of the donor of the fête.</div>

<p class='c001'><b>Sarsūt</b>, <b>Saraswat Brāhman</b>.—Sarsut (properly Sarasvati)
Brahmans are found in considerable numbers throughout this
tract. They aver that they were masters of the country prior to
the Jat colonists. They are a peaceable, industrious race, and
without a single prejudice of ‘the order’; they eat meat, smoke
tobacco, cultivate the soil, and trade even in the sacred kine,
notwithstanding their descent from Sringi Rishi, son of Brahma.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Charans.</h4>—The Charans are the sacred order of these regions;
the warlike tribes esteem [199] the heroic lays of the bard more
than the homily of the Brahman. The Charans are throughout
reverenced by the Rathors, and hold lands, literally, on the tenure
of ‘an old song.’ More will be said of them in the Annals of
Jaisalmer.</div>

<p class='c001'><b>Mālis</b>, <b>Nāis</b>.—Malis, Nais, gardeners and barbers, are important
members of every Rajput family, and to be found in all
the villages, of which they are invariably the cooks.</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Chuhras</b>, <b>Thoris</b>.—Chuhras, Thoris, are actually castes of
robbers:<a id='r6.2.4' /><a href='#f6.2.4' class='c013'><sup>[4]</sup></a> the former, from the Lakhi Jungle; the latter, from
Mewar. Most of the chieftains have a few in their pay, entertained
for the most desperate services. The Bahaduran chief has
expelled all his Rajputs, and retains only Chuhras and Thoris.
The Chuhras are highly esteemed for fidelity, and the barriers
and portals throughout this tract are in their custody. They
enjoy a very singular perquisite, which would go far to prove
their being the aborigines of the country; namely, a fee of four
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1149'>1149</span>copper coins on every dead subject, when the funeral ceremonies
are over.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Rājputs.</h4>—The Rathors of Bikaner are unchanged in their
martial qualifications, bearing as high a reputation as any other
class in India; and whilst their brethren of Marwar, Amber, and
Mewar have been for years groaning under the rapacious visitations
of Mahrattas and Pathans, their distance and the difficulties
of the country have saved them from such afflictions; though,
in truth, they have had enough to endure at home, in the tyranny
of their own lord. The Rathors of the desert have fewer prejudices
than their more eastern brethren; they will eat food,
without enquiring by whom it was dressed, and will drink either
wine or water, without asking to whom the cup belonged. They
would make the best soldiers in the world if they would submit
to discipline, as they are brave, hardy, easily satisfied, and very
patient; though, on the other hand, they have imbibed some
qualities, since their migration to these regions, which could only
be eradicated in the rising generation: especially the inordinate
use of opium, and smoking intoxicating herbs, in both which
accomplishments ‘the sons of Bika’ are said to bear the palm
from the rest of the Chhattis rajkula, the Thirty-six Royal Tribes
of India. The <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>piyala</em></span>, or ‘cup,’ is a favourite with every Rajput
who can afford it, and is, as well as opium, a panacea for ennui,
arising from the absence of all mental stimulants, in which they
are more deficient, from the nature of the country, than most of
their warlike countrymen.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Face of the Country.</h4>—The whole of this principality, with the
exception of a few isolated spots, or oases, scattered here and
there, consists more or less of sand. From the eastern to the
western boundary, in the line of greatest breadth, it is one continuous
[200] plain of sand, though the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>tibas</em></span>, or sandhills, commence
in the centre of the country, the principal chain running
in the direction of Jaisalmer, and shooting forth subordinate
branches in every direction; or it might be more correct to
designate this main ridge, originating in the tracts bordering the
eastern valley of the Indus, as terminating its elevations about
the heart of Bikaner. On the north-east quarter, from Rajgarh
to Nohar and Rawatsar, the soil is good, being black earth, slightly
mixed with sand, and having water near enough to the surface
for irrigation; it produces wheat, gram, and even rice, in considerable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1150'>1150</span>quantities. The same soil exists from Bhatner to the
banks of the Gara. The whole of the Mohila tract is a fertile
oasis, the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>tibas</em></span> just terminating their extreme offsets on its
northern limit: being flooded in the periodical rains, wheat is
abundantly produced.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Products of the Desert.</h4>—But exclusive of such spots, which
are “few and far between,” we cannot describe the desert as a
waste where “no salutary plant takes root, no verdure quickens”;
for though the poverty of the soil refuses to aid the germination
of the more luxuriant grains, Providence has provided a countervailing
good, in giving to those it can rear a richness and superiority
unknown to more favoured regions. The bajra of the desert is
far superior to any grown in the rich loam of Malwa, and its
inhabitant retains an instinctive partiality, even when admitted
to revel in the luxurious repasts of Mewar or Amber, for the
<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>vatis</em></span> or <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>batis</em></span> or ‘bajra cakes,’ of his native sandhills, and not
more from association than from their intrinsic excellence. In a
plentiful season they save enough for two years’ consumption.
The grain requires not much water, though it is of the last importance
that this little should be timely.</div>

<p class='c001'>Besides bajra we may mention moth and til;<a id='r6.2.5' /><a href='#f6.2.5' class='c013'><sup>[5]</sup></a> the former a
useful pulse both for men and cattle; the other the oil-plant,
used both for culinary purposes and burning. Wheat, gram, and
barley are produced in the favoured spots described, but in these
are enumerated the staple products of Bikaner.</p>

<p class='c001'>Cotton is grown in the tracts favourable for wheat.<a id='r6.2.6' /><a href='#f6.2.6' class='c013'><sup>[6]</sup></a> The
plant is said to be septennial, even decennial, in these regions.
As soon as the cotton is gathered, the shoots are all cut off, and
the root alone left. Each succeeding year, the plant increases
in strength, and at length attains a size unknown where it is more
abundantly cultivated.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nature has bountifully supplied many spontaneous vegetable
products for the use of man, and excellent pasture for cattle.
Guar, Kachri, Kakri, all of the cucurbitaceous family, and water-melons
of a gigantic size, are produced in great plenty.<a id='r6.2.7' /><a href='#f6.2.7' class='c013'><sup>[7]</sup></a> The
latter is most valuable; for being cut in slices and dried in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1151'>1151</span>sun, it is stored up [201] for future use when vegetables are scarce,
or in times of famine, on which they always calculate. It is also
an article of commerce, and much admired even where vegetables
are more abundant. The copious mucilage of the dried melon is
extremely nourishing; and deeming it valuable as an anti-scorbutic
in sea voyages, the Author sent some of it to Calcutta
many years ago for experiment.<a id='r6.2.8' /><a href='#f6.2.8' class='c013'><sup>[8]</sup></a> Our Indian ships would find
no difficulty in obtaining a plentiful supply of this article, as it
can be cultivated to any extent, and thus be made to confer a
double benefit on our seamen and the inhabitants of those desert
regions. The superior magnitude of the water-melons of the
desert over those of interior India gives rise to much exaggeration,
and it has been gravely asserted by travellers in the sand <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>tibas</em></span>,<a id='r6.2.9' /><a href='#f6.2.9' class='c013'><sup>[9]</sup></a>
where they are most abundant, that the mucilage of one is
sufficient to allay the thirst both of a horse and his rider.</p>

<p class='c001'>In these arid regions, where they depend entirely on the
heavens for water, and where they calculate on a famine every
seventh year, nothing that can administer to the wants of man
is lost. The seeds of the wild grasses, as the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>bharut</em></span>, <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>baru</em></span>, <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>harara</em></span>,
<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>sawan</em></span>, are collected, and, mixed with bajra-flour, enter much
into the food of the poorer classes. They also store up great
quantities of the wild <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>ber</em></span>, <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>khair</em></span>, and <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>karel</em></span> berries; and the long
pods of the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>khejra</em></span>, astringent and bitter as they are, are dried
and formed into a flour. Nothing is lost in these regions which
can be converted into food.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Trees.</h4>—Trees they have none indigenous (mangoes and
tamarind are planted about the capital), but abundant shrubs,
as the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>babul</em></span>, and ever-green <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>pilu</em></span>, the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>jhal</em></span>, and others yielding
berries. The Bidawats, indeed, apply the term ‘tree’ to the
<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>rohira</em></span>, which sometimes attains the height of twenty feet, and is
transported to all parts for house-building; as likewise is the
<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>nima</em></span>, so well known throughout India. The <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>phog</em></span> is the most
useful of all these, as with its twigs they frame a wicker-work to
line their wells, and prevent the sand from falling in.</div>

<p class='c001'>The <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>ak</em></span>, a species of euphorbia, known in Hindustan as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1152'>1152</span><span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>madar</em></span>, grows to an immense height and strength in the desert;
from its fibres they make the ropes in general use throughout
these regions, and they are reckoned superior, both in substance
and durability, to those formed of <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>munj</em></span> (hemp), which is however
cultivated in the lands of the Bidawats.</p>

<p class='c001'>Their agricultural implements are simple and suited to the
soil. The plough is one [202] of single yoke, either for the camel
or ox: that with double yoke being seldom required, or chiefly
by the Malis (gardeners), when the soil is of some consistence.
The drill is invariably used, and the grains are dropped singly
into the ground, at some distance from each other, and each
sends forth a dozen to twenty stalks. A bundle of bushes forms
their harrow. The grain is trodden out by oxen; and the moth
(pulse), which is even more productive than the bajra, by camels.</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Water.</b>—This indispensable element is at an immense distance
from the surface throughout the Indian desert, which, in this
respect, as well as many others, differs very materially from that
portion of the great African Desert in the same latitudes. Water
at twenty feet, as found at Mourzook by Captain Lyon, is here
unheard of, and the degree of cold experienced by him at Zuela,
on the winter solstice, would have “burnt up” every natural
and cultivated production of our Hindu Sahara. Captain Lyon
describes the thermometer in lat. 26°, within 2° of zero of Reaumur.
Majors Denham and Clapperton never mark it under 40° of
Fahrenheit, and mention ice, which I never saw but once, the
thermometer being 28°; and then not only the mouths of our
<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>mashaks</em></span>, or ‘water-skins,’ were frozen, but a small pond, protected
from the wind (I heard, for I saw it not), exhibited a very
thin pellicle of ice. When at 30° the cold was deemed intense by
the inhabitants of Maru in the tracts limiting the desert, and
the useful <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>ak</em></span>, and other shrubs, were scorched and withered; and
in north lat. 25°, the thermometer being 28°, desolation and woe
spread throughout the land. To use their own phrase, the crops
of gram and other pulses were completely “burnt up, as if scorched
by the lightnings of heaven”; while the sun’s meridian heat
would raise it 50° more, or up to 80°, a degree of variability at
least not recorded by Captain Lyon.</p>

<p class='c001'>At Deshnokh,<a id='r6.2.10' /><a href='#f6.2.10' class='c013'><sup>[10]</sup></a> near the capital, the wells are more than two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1153'>1153</span>hundred cubits, or three hundred feet, in depth; and it is rare
that water fit for man is found at a less distance from the surface
than sixty, in the tracts decidedly termed <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>thal</em></span>, or ‘desert’:
though some of the flats, or oases, such as that of Mohila, are
exceptions, and abundance of brackish water, fit for cattle, is
found throughout at half this depth, or about thirty feet. All
the wells are lined with basket-work made of <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>phog</em></span> twigs, and the
water is generally drawn up by hand-lines [203].<a id='r6.2.11' /><a href='#f6.2.11' class='c013'><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><b>Sar, or ‘Salt Lakes.’</b>—There are a few salt lakes, which, throughout
the whole of the Indian desert, are termed <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>sar</em></span>, though none
are of the same consequence as those of Marwar. The largest is
at the town of Sar,<a id='r6.2.12' /><a href='#f6.2.12' class='c013'><sup>[12]</sup></a> so named after the lake, which is about six
miles in circumference. There is another at Chhapar about two
miles in length, and although each of them frequently contains a
depth of four feet of water, this entirely evaporates in the hot
winds, leaving a thick sheet of saline incrustation. The salt of
both is deemed of inferior quality to that of the more southerly
lakes.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Physiography of the Country.</h4>—There is little to vary the
physiography of this region, and small occasion to boast either of
its physical or moral beauties; yet, strange to say, I have met
with many whose love of country was stronger than their perceptions
of abstract veracity, who would dwell on its perfections, and
prefer a mess of <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>rabri</em></span>, or porridge made of bajra, to the greater
delicacies of more civilized regions. To such, the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>tibas</em></span>, or ‘sand-ridges,’
might be more important than the Himalaya, and their
diminutive and scanty brushwood might eclipse the gigantic
foliage of this huge barrier. Verdure itself may be abhorrent to
eyes accustomed to behold only arid sands; and a region without
<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>tufans</em></span> or ‘whirlwinds’; or armies of locusts rustling like a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1154'>1154</span>tempest, and casting long shadows on the lands, might be deemed
by the prejudiced, deficient in the true sublime. Occasionally
the sandstone formation rises above the surface, resembling a few
low isolated hills; and those who dwell on the boundaries of
Nagor, if they have a love of more decided elevations than their
native sandhills afford, may indulge in a distant view of the
terminations of the Aravalli.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Mineral Productions.</h4>—The mineral productions of this country
are scanty. They have excellent quarries of freestone in several
parts, especially at Hasera, thirteen coss to the north-east of the
capital, which yield a small revenue estimated at two thousand
rupees annually. There are also copper mines at Biramsar and
Bidesar; but the former does not repay the expense of working,
and the latter, having been worked for thirty years, is nearly
exhausted.</div>

<p class='c001'>An unctuous clay is excavated from a pit, near Kolait, in large
quantities, and exported as an article of commerce, besides adding
fifteen hundred rupees annually to the treasury. It is used chiefly
to free the skin and hair from impurities, and the Cutchi ladies
are said to eat it to improve their complexions.<a id='r6.2.13' /><a href='#f6.2.13' class='c013'><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Animal Productions.</h4>—The kine of the desert are highly
esteemed; as are the camels, especially those used for expedition
and the saddle, which bear a high price,<a id='r6.2.14' /><a href='#f6.2.14' class='c013'><sup>[14]</sup></a> and are [204] considered
superior to any in India. They are beautifully formed, and the
head possesses much blood and symmetry. Sheep are reared in
great abundance, and find no want of food in the excellent grasses
and shrubs which abound. The <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>phog</em></span>, <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>jawas</em></span>,<a id='r6.2.15' /><a href='#f6.2.15' class='c013'><sup>[15]</sup></a> and other prickly
shrubs, which are here indigenous, form the dainties of the camel
in other regions. The Nilgae, or elk, and deer of every kind, are
plentiful; and the fox of the desert is a beautiful little animal.
Jackals and hyaenas are not scarce, and even lions are by no
means unknown in Bikaner.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Commerce and Manufactures.</h4>—Rajgarh<a id='r6.2.16' /><a href='#f6.2.16' class='c013'><sup>[16]</sup></a> was the great commercial
mart of this country, and the point of rendezvous for
caravans from all parts. The produce of the Panjab and Kashmir
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1155'>1155</span>came formerly direct by Hansi-Hisar—that of the eastern countries
by Delhi, Rewari, Dadri, etc., consisting of silks, fine cloths,
indigo, sugar, iron, tobacco, etc.; from Haraoti and Malwa came
opium, which supplied all the Rajput States; from Sind, via
Jaisalmer, and by caravans from Multan and Shikarpur, dates,
wheat, rice, <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>lungis</em></span> (silk vestments for women), fruits, etc.; from
Pali, the imports from maritime countries, as spices, tin, drugs,
coco-nuts, elephants’ teeth, etc. Much of this was for internal
consumption, but the greater part a mere transit trade, which
yielded considerable revenue.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Woollens.</h4>—The wool of the sheep pastured in the desert is,
however, the staple commodity both of manufacture and trade in
this region. It is worked into every article of dress, both male
and female, and worn by all, rich and poor. It is produced from
the loom, of every texture and quality, from the coarse <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>loi</em></span> or
‘blanket,’ at three rupees per pair (six shillings), to thirty rupees.
The quality of these last is very fine, of an intermediate texture
between the shawl and camlet, and without any nap; it is always
bordered with a stripe of chocolate brown or red. Of this quality
are the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>dopattas</em></span> or ‘scarfs’ for the ladies. Turbans are also
manufactured of it, and though frequently from forty to sixty-one
feet in length, such is the fineness of the web, that they are not
bulky on the head.</div>

<p class='c001'>From the milk of the sheep and goats as well as kine, <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>ghi</em></span> or
‘clarified butter’ is made, and forms an important article of
trade.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Manufactures in Iron.</h4>—The Bikaneris work well in iron, and
have shops at the capital and all the large towns for the manufacture
of sword blades, matchlocks, daggers, iron lances, etc.
The sword-handles, which are often inlaid with variegated steel,
or burnished, are in high request, and exported to various parts
of India. They have also expert artists in ivory, though the
articles are chiefly such as are worn by females, as <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>churis</em></span>, or
‘bracelets’ [205].</div>

<p class='c001'>Coarse cotton cloths, for internal consumption, are made in
considerable quantities.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Fairs.</h4>—Annual fairs were held, in the months of Karttik and
Phalgun, at the towns of Kolait and Gajner,<a id='r6.2.17' /><a href='#f6.2.17' class='c013'><sup>[17]</sup></a> and frequented by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1156'>1156</span>the merchants of the adjacent countries. They were celebrated
for cattle, chiefly the produce of the desert, camels, kine, and
horses from Multan and the Lakhi Jungle,<a id='r6.2.18' /><a href='#f6.2.18' class='c013'><sup>[18]</sup></a> a breed now almost
extinct. These fairs have lost all their celebrity; in fact, commerce
in these regions is extinct.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Government Revenues.</h4>—The personal revenues of the Raja
were derived from a variety of sources: from the Khalisa, or
‘crown-lands’ imposts, taxes on agriculture, and that compendious
item which makes up the deficiencies in all oriental
budgets, <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>dand</em></span>, or ‘contribution.’ But with all these “appliances
and means to boot,” the civil list of this desert king seldom exceeded
five lakhs of rupees, or about £50,000 per annum.<a id='r6.2.19' /><a href='#f6.2.19' class='c013'><sup>[19]</sup></a> The
lands of the feudality are more extensive proportionally in this
region than in any other in Rajputana, arising out of the original
settlement, when the Bidawats and Kandhalots, whose joint
acquisitions exceeded those of Bika, would not admit him to
hold lands in their territory, and made but a slight pecuniary
acknowledgment of his supremacy. The districts in which the
crown-lands lie are Rajgarh, Reni, Nohar, Gharib, Ratangarh,
Rania, and more recently Churu.</div>

<p class='c001'>The following are the items of the revenue: (1) Khalisa, or
fiscal revenue; (2) Dhuan; (3) Anga; (4) Town and transit
duties; (5) Paseti, or ‘plough-tax’; (6) Malba.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Khālisa Lands.</h4>—1. The fisc. Formerly this branch of revenue
yielded two lakhs of rupees; but with progressive superstition
and prodigality, the raja has alienated almost two-thirds of the
villages from which the revenue was drawn. These amounted
to two hundred; now they do not exceed eighty, and their
revenue is not more than one lakh of rupees. Surat Singh is
guided only by caprice; his rewards are uniform, no matter what
the service or the object, whether a Brahman or a camel-driver.
The Khalisa is the only source which he considers he has merely
a life-interest in. To supply the deficiencies, he has direct
recourse to the pockets of his subjects.</div>

<div class='section-start'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1157'>1157</span><h4 class='disp-inline'>Hearth-Tax.</h4>—2. Dhuan may be rendered hearth-tax, though
literally it is a smoke (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>dhuan</em></span>) tax. All must eat; food must be
dressed; and as they have neither chimneys nor glass windows
on which to lay the tax, Surat Singh’s chancellor of the exchequer
makes the smoke pay a transit duty ere it gets vent from the
various orifices of the edifice. It only amounts to one rupee on
each house or family, but would form an important item if not
evaded by the powerful chiefs; still it yields a lakh of rupees.
The town [206] of Mahajan, which was settled on Ratan Singh,
son of Raja Nunkaran, on the resignation of his right of primogeniture
and succession, enjoys exemption from this tax. It is
less liable to fluctuation than other taxes, for if a village becomes
half-deserted, those who remain are saddled with the whole.
Dhuan is only known to the two western States, Bikaner and
Jaisalmer.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Poll-Tax.</h4>—3. <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>Anga.</em></span> This is not a capitation but a body tax
(from <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>anga</em></span>, the body), and was established by Raja Anup Singh.
It might almost be termed a property-tax, since it embraced
quadrupeds as well as bipeds of every sex and age, and was
graduated according to age and sex in the human species, and
according to utility in the brute. Each male adult was assessed
one <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>anga</em></span>, fixed at four annas (about sixpence), and cows, oxen,
buffaloes, were placed upon a level with the lord of the creation.
Ten goats or sheep were estimated as one <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>anga</em></span>; but a camel was
equivalent to four <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>angas</em></span>, or one rupee, which Raja Gaj Singh
doubled. This tax, which is by far the most certain in a country
perhaps still more pastoral than agricultural, is most providently
watched, and though it has undergone many changes since
it was originally imposed, it yet yields annually two lakhs of
rupees.</div>

<p class='c001'>4. <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>Sāīr</em></span>, or ‘imposts.’ This branch is subject to much fluctuation,
and has diminished greatly since the reign of Surat Singh.
The duties levied in the capital alone formerly exceeded what is
collected throughout the whole of his dominions; being once
estimated at above two lakhs, and now under one. Of this
amount, half is collected at Rajgarh, the chief commercial mart
of Bikaner. The dread of the Rahats, who have cut off the
communications with the Panjab, and the want of principle
within, deter merchants from visiting this State, and the caravans
from Multan, Bahawalpur, and Shikarpur, which passed through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1158'>1158</span>Bikaner to the eastern States, have nearly abandoned the route.
The only duties of which he is certain are those on grain, of four
rupees on every hundred maunds sold or exported, and which,
according to the average sale price of these regions, may be
about two per cent.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Paseti.</h4>—5. Paseti is a tax of five<a id='r6.2.20' /><a href='#f6.2.20' class='c013'><sup>[20]</sup></a> rupees on every plough used
in agriculture. It was introduced by Raja Rae Singh, in commutation
of the corn-tax, or levy in kind, which had long been
established at one-fourth of the gross produce. The Jats were
glad to compound, and get rid of the agents of corruption, by
the substitution of the plough-tax. It formerly yielded two
lakhs of rupees, but with decreasing agriculture has fallen, like
every other source, to a little more than one-half, but still yields
a lakh and a quarter.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Malba.</h4>—6. Malba<a id='r6.2.21' /><a href='#f6.2.21' class='c013'><sup>[21]</sup></a> is the name of the original tax which the
Jat communities imposed [207] upon themselves, when they
submitted to the sway in perpetuity of Bika and his successors.
It is the land-tax<a id='r6.2.22' /><a href='#f6.2.22' class='c013'><sup>[22]</sup></a> of two rupees on each hundred bighas of land
cultivated in Bikaner. It is now unproductive, not realizing
fifty thousand rupees, and it is said that a composition has been
effected, by which it has been, or will be, relinquished: if so,
Surat Singh gives up the sole legitimate source of revenue he
possesses.</div>

<p class='c001'>Besides this, the fullest amount arising to the prince from
annual taxation, there are other items which occasionally replenish
the treasure of Surat Singh.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Datoi.</h4>—Datoi is a triennial tax of five rupees levied on each
plough.<a id='r6.2.25' /><a href='#f6.2.25' class='c013'><sup>[25]</sup></a> It was instituted by Raja Zorawar Singh. The whole
country is liable to it, with the exception of fifty villages in
Asaichwati, and seventy of the Beniwals, conditionally exempted,
to guard the borders. It is now frequently evaded by the feudal
chieftains, and seldom yields a lakh of rupees.</div>

<p class='c001'>In addition to these specific expedients, there are many
arbitrary methods of increasing the “ways and means” to satisfy
the necessities or avarice of the present ruler, and [208] a train
of dependent harpies, who prey upon the cultivating peasantry,
or industrious trader. By such shifts, Surat Singh has been
known to double his fixed revenue.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Dand, Khushhali.</h4>—The terms Dand and Khushhali, though
etymologically the antipodes of each other—the first meaning a
‘compulsory contribution,’ the other a ‘benevolence, or voluntary,’<a id='r6.2.26' /><a href='#f6.2.26' class='c013'><sup>[26]</sup></a>—have
a similar interpretation in these regions, and make
the subjects of those parts devoutly pray that their prince’s
house may be one rather of mourning than rejoicing, and that
defeat rather than victory may be attendant on his arms.</div>

<p class='c001'>The term dand is coeval with Hindu legislation. The bard
Chand describes it, and the chronicler of the life of the great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1160'>1160</span>Siddhraj of Anhilwara, “who expelled the seven Daddas,” or
‘great evils,’ whose initial letter was <em>d</em>, enumerates dand as one
of them, and places it with the Dholis and Dakins, or minstrels
and witches, giving it precedence amongst the seven plagues
which his ancestors and tyrant custom had inflicted on the subject.
Unhappily, there is no Siddhraj to legislate for Rajputana; and
were there fourteen Daddas by which Surat Singh could swell
his budget, he would retain them all for the oppression of the
impoverished Jats, who, if they could, would be happy to expel
the letter <cite>S</cite> from amongst them. But it is from the chieftain,
the merchant, and the banker that the chief sums are realized;
though indirectly the poor peasant contributes his share. There
are fourteen collectors of dand,<a id='r6.2.27' /><a href='#f6.2.27' class='c013'><sup>[27]</sup></a> one to every <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>chira</em></span> or division,
and these are furnished with arbitrary schedules according to
the circumstances, actual or supposed, of each individual. So
unlimited are these exactions, that the chief of Gandeli for two
years offered the collector of his quarter ten thousand rupees if
he would guarantee him against any further demand during even
twelve months; and being refused, he turned the collector out,
shut the gates of his castle, and boldly bid his master defiance.</p>

<p class='c001'>One of his expedients to levy a khushhali, or ‘benevolence,’ is
worth relating: it was on the termination of his expedition
against Bhatner, which added this celebrated desert and castle
to his territory, and in which he was attended by the entire
feudal army of Bikaner. On his return, “flushed with conquest,”
he demanded from each house throughout his dominions the sum
of ten rupees to cover the expenses of the war. If the tyrant-ridden
subjects of Surat Singh thus rejoice in his successes, how
must they feel for his defeats! To them both are alike ominous,
when every [209] artifice is welcomed, every villainy practised,
to impoverish them. Oppression is at its height, and must work
out its own cure.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Feudal Levies.</h4>—The disposable force of all these feudal principalities
must depend on the personal character of the Raja. If
Surat Singh were popular, and the national emergencies demanded
the assemblage of the Kher, or <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>levée en masse</em></span>, of the “sons of
Bika,” he might bring ten thousand Rajputs into the field, of
whom twelve hundred might be good horse, besides the foreign
troops and park; but under present circumstances, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1161'>1161</span>rapid deterioration of every branch of society, it may be doubted
whether one-half could be collected under his standard.</div>

<p class='c001'>The household troops consist of a battalion of foreign infantry,
of five hundred men with five guns, and three squadrons of horse,
about two hundred and fifty in number; all under foreign
leaders. This is independent of the garrison of the capital, whose
commandant is a Rajput of the Parihar tribe, who has twenty-five
villages assigned for the payment of his troops.<a id='r6.2.28' /><a href='#f6.2.28' class='c013'><sup>[28]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c024'>CHAPTER 3</h3>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Bhatner.</h4>—Bhatner, which now forms an integral part of
Bikaner, was anciently the chief abode of another Jat community,
so powerful as at one time to provoke the vengeance of kings,
and at others to succour them when in distress. It is asserted
that its name is in nowise connected with the Bhattis, who
colonized it, but derived from the Bardai, or Bhat, of a powerful
prince, to whom the lands were granted, and who, desirous to
be the founder of a poetic dynasty, gave his professional title to
the abode. In the annals of Jaisalmer, it will be seen that there
is another story accounting for the appellation, which recalls the
founding of Carthage or Byrsa. Both legends are improbable;
and the Bhatti annals confirm what might have been assumed
without suspicion, that to a colony of this race Bhatner owes its
name, though not its existence. The whole of the northern part
is called Ner in the ancient geographical nomenclature of Marusthali;
and when some of the Bhatti clans became proselytes to
Islam, they changed the vowel <em>a</em> to <em>u</em>, to distinguish them from
the parent stock, namely [212], Bhati for Bhatti.<a id='r6.3.1' /><a href='#f6.3.1' class='c013'><sup>[1]</sup></a> We shall,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1164'>1164</span>however, furnish evidence by and by, in the annals of the original
race, that in all probability the Yadu-Bhatti is the original Yuti
colony from Central Asia; and that “the Jat prince of Salpur,”
whose inscription is in the first volume of this work, was the
predecessor of these very races.</div>

<p class='c001'>Neither the tract depending on Bhatner, nor that north of it
to the Gara River, presented formerly the scene of absolute
desolation they now exhibit, and I shall append a list of towns,
to which a high antiquity is assigned, whose vestiges still remain,
and from which something might perhaps be gleaned to confirm
or overturn these deductions.</p>

<p class='c001'>Bhatner has attained great historical celebrity from its position,
being in the route of invasion from Central Asia to India. It is
more than probable that the Jats, who resisted the advance of
Mahmud of Ghazni in a naval warfare on the Indus, had long
before that period established themselves in the desert as well as
in the Panjab; and as we find them occupying a place amongst
the Thirty-six Royal Tribes, we may infer that they had political
power many centuries before that conqueror. In <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1205, only
twelve years after the conquest of India by Shihabu-d-din, his
successor, Kutb, was compelled to conduct the war in person
against the Jats of the northern desert, to prevent their wresting
the important post of Hansi from the empire;<a id='r6.3.2' /><a href='#f6.3.2' class='c013'><sup>[2]</sup></a> and when the
unfortunate and intrepid queen Raziyah, the worthy heiress of
the great Firoz, was compelled to abandon her throne to a usurper,
she sought and found protection amongst the Jats, who, with
their Scythic brethren, the Gakkhars, assembled all their forces
and marched, with their queen at their head, like Tomyris of old,
to meet her foes.<a id='r6.3.3' /><a href='#f6.3.3' class='c013'><sup>[3]</sup></a> She was not destined to enjoy the same revenge,
but gained a glorious death in the attempt to overturn the Salic
law of India.<a id='r6.3.4' /><a href='#f6.3.4' class='c013'><sup>[4]</sup></a> Again, in <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1397, when Timur invaded India,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1165'>1165</span>Bhatner was attacked for “having distressed him exceedingly
on his invasion of Multan,” when he “in person scoured the
country, and cut off a tribe of banditti called Jats.”<a id='r6.3.5' /><a href='#f6.3.5' class='c013'><sup>[5]</sup></a> In short,
the Bhattis and Jats were so intermingled that distinction was
impossible. Leaving this point, therefore, to be adjusted in the
annals of the Bhattis, we proceed to sketch the history of the
colony which ruled Bhatner when subjugated by the Rathors.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Bhatti Migration.</h4>—It was shortly after Timur’s invasion
that a colony of Bhattis migrated from Marot and Phulra, under
their leader Bersi, and assaulted and captured Bhatner from a
[213] Muhammadan chief; but whether one of Timur’s officers,
or a dependent of Delhi, remains unknown, though most probably
the former. His name, Chaghat Khan, almost renders this
certain, and they must have made a proper name out of his tribe,
Chagatai, of which he was a noble. This Khan had conquered
Bhatner from the Jats, and had acquired a considerable territory,
which the Bhatti colony took advantage of his return to invade
and conquer. Sixteen generations have intervened since this
event, which, bringing it to the period of Timur’s invasion, furnishes
an additional reason for concluding the Khan of Bhatner
to have been one of his nobles, whom he may have left entrusted
with this important point of communication, should he meditate
further intercourse with India.</div>

<p class='c001'>Bersi ruled twenty-seven years, and was succeeded by his son
Bhairon, when the sons of Chaghat Khan, obtaining aid from the
Delhi monarch, invaded Bhatner, and were twice repulsed with
great loss. A third army succeeded; Bhatner was invested and
reduced to great straits, when Bhairon hung out a flag of truce,
and offered to accept any conditions which would not compromise
his castle. Two were named: to embrace Islamism, or seal his
sincerity by giving his daughter to the king. He accepted the
first alternative, and from that day, in order to distinguish these
proselytes, they changed the name of Bhati to Bhatti. Six
chiefs intervened between Bhairon and</p>

<p class='c001'>Rao Dalich, surnamed Hayat Khan, from whom Rae Singh of
Bikaner wrested Bhatner, and Fatehabad became the future
residence of the Bhatti Khans. He was succeeded by</p>

<p class='c001'>Husain Khan (the grandson of Hayat), who recaptured
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1166'>1166</span>Bhatner from Raja Shujawan Singh, and it was maintained
during the time of Husain Mahmud and Imam Mahmud, until
Surat Singh made the final conquest of it from Bahadur Khan,
father to the present titular head of the Bhattis,<a id='r6.3.6' /><a href='#f6.3.6' class='c013'><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Zabita Khan, who resides at Reni, having about twenty-five
villages dependent thereon.<a id='r6.3.7' /><a href='#f6.3.7' class='c013'><sup>[7]</sup></a> Reni was founded by Rae Singh of
Bikaner, and named after his queen (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>Rani</em></span>), to whom it was
assigned. It was taken by Imam Mahmud. The Bhatti Khan
is now a robber by profession, and his revenues, which are said
to have sometimes amounted to three lakhs of rupees, are extorted
by the point of his lance. These [214] depredations are carried
to a frightful extent, and the poor Jats are kept eternally on the
alert to defend their property. The proximity of the British
territory preventing all incursions to the eastward, they are
thrown back upon their original haunts, and make the whole of
this northern region their prey. To this circumstance is attributed
the desertion of these lands, which once reared cattle in
abundance, and were highly valued. It is asserted that from the
northern boundary of Bhatner to the Gara there are many tracts
susceptible of high cultivation, having water near the surface,
and many large spaces entirely free from <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>thal</em></span>, or ‘sandhills.’ To
the drying up of the Hakra, or Ghaggar, many centuries ago, in
conjunction with moral evils, is ascribed the existing desolation.
According to tradition, this stream took a westerly direction, by
Phulra, where it is yet to be traced, and fell into the Indus below
Uchh. The couplet recording its absorption by the sands of
Ner has already been given, in the time of Rao Hamir, prince of
Dhat. If the next European traveller who may pass through
the Indian desert will seek out the representative of the ancient
Sodha princes at Chor, near Umarkot, he may learn from their
bard (if they retain such an appendage) the date of this prince,
and that of so important an event in the physical and political
history of their regions. The vestiges of large towns, now buried
in the sands, confirm the truth of this tradition, and several of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1167'>1167</span>them claim a high antiquity; such as the Rangmahall, already
mentioned, west of Bhatner, having subterranean apartments
still in good preservation. An aged native of Dandusar (twenty-five
miles south of Bhatner) replied, to my inquiry as to the
recollections attached to this place, that “it belonged to a Panwar
prince who ruled once all these regions, when Sikandar Rumi
attacked them.”</p>

<p class='c001'>An excursion from Hansi Hissar, our western frontier, into
these regions, would soon put the truth of such traditions to the
test, as far as these reported ruins are concerned; though what
might appear the remains of palaces of the Pramaras, the Johyas,
and the Jats of ancient days, to the humble occupant of a hut
in the desert, may only prove the foundations of some castellated
building. But the same traditions are circulated with regard to
the more western desert, where the same kind of vestiges is said
to exist, and the annals make mention of capitals, the sites of
which are now utterly unknown. Considering the safety, and
comparative ease, with which such a journey can be made, one
cannot imagine a more agreeable pursuit than the prosecution
of archaeological inquiries in the northern deserts of Rajputana,
where traditions abound, and where the existing manners, amongst
such a diversity of tribes, would furnish ample materials [215] for
the portfolio, as well as for memoirs. Its productions, spontaneous
or cultivated, though its botanical as well as zoological
specimens may be limited, we know to be essentially different
from those of Gangetic India, and more likely to find a parallel
in the natural productions and phenomena of the great African
desert. The Bhattis, the Khosas, the Rajars, the Sahariyas, the
Mangalias, the Sodhas, and various other nomadic tribes, present
a wide field for observation; and the physiologist, when tired
of the habits of man, may descend from the nobler animal to the
lion, the wild ass, every kind of deer, the flocks of sheep which,
fed on the succulent grasses, touch not water for six weeks together,
while the various herbs, esculent plants and shrubs, salt
lakes, natron beds, etc., would give abundant scope for commentary
and useful comparison. He will discover no luxuries,
and few signs of civilization; the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>jhonpra</em></span> (hut) constructed of
poles and twigs, coated inside with mud and covered with grass,
being little better than the African’s dwelling.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Ancient Cities.</h4>—We shall conclude this imperfect sketch of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1168'>1168</span>Bikaner and the desert with the names of several of their ancient
towns, which may aid the search of the traveller in the regions
on its northern border: Abohar; Banjara ka Nagar; Rangmahall;
Sodal, or Soratgarh; Machotal; Ratibang; Kalibang;
Kalyansar; Phulra; Marot; Tilwara; Gilwara; Bani; Manikkhar;

even one, should be the means of eliciting some knowledge of the
past, the record will not be useless.</p>

<p class='c001'>Phulra and Marot have still some importance: the first is very
ancient, and enumerated amongst the ‘Nau-koti Maru-ki,’ in the
earliest periods of Pramara (vulg. Panwar) dominion. I have no
doubt that inscriptions in the ornamental nail-headed character
belonging to the Jains will be found here, having obtained one
from Lodorva in the desert, which has been a ruin for nine centuries.
Phulra was the residence of Lakha Phulani, a name well
known to those versed in the old traditions of the desert. He
was cotemporary with Siddh Rae of Anhilwara, and Udayaditya
of Dhar [216].</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>BOOK VII <br /> <span class='fss'>ANNALS OF JAISALMER</span></h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c024'>CHAPTER 1</h3>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Limits of Jaisalmer.</h4>—Jaisalmer is the modern name of a tract
of country comprehended, according to ancient geography, in
Marusthali, the desert of India. It is termed Mer in the traditional
nomenclature of this region, from being a rocky (mer)
oasis in the heart of the sandy desert, interesting both from its
physical features and its position as the Ultima Thule of independent
Hinduism. Yet, however entitled to regard from its
local peculiarities or its products, the history of the tribe which
inhabits it presents a still more engrossing subject for investigation.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Bhatti Tribe.</h4>—This tribe is the Bhatti, a branch of the
Yadu or Jadon race, whose power was paramount in India three
thousand years ago; and the prince now governing this distant
[217] corner of India claims descent from those Yadu kings who
ruled from the Yamuna to the ‘world’s end,’<a id='r7.1.1' /><a href='#f7.1.1' class='c013'><sup>[1]</sup></a> at that remote
period.</div>

<p class='c001'>It were preposterous to expect to find, in the annals of a people
so subject to the vicissitudes of fortune, an unbroken series of
historical evidence in support of this ancestry; but they have
preserved links of the chain which indicate original affinities. In
tracing the Yadu-Bhatti history, two hypotheses alternately present
themselves to our minds, each of which rests upon plausible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1170'>1170</span>grounds; the one supposing the Bhattis to be of Scythic, the
other of Hindu origin. This incongruity may be reconciled by
presuming the co-mixture of the two primitive races; by enlarging
our views, and contemplating the barrier, which in remote
ages separated Scythia and India, as ideal; and admitting that
the various communities, from the Caspian to the Ganges, were
members of one grand family, having a common language and
common faith,<a id='r7.1.2' /><a href='#f7.1.2' class='c013'><sup>[2]</sup></a> in that ancient central empire whose existence
has been contended for and denied by the first names in science;<a id='r7.1.3' /><a href='#f7.1.3' class='c013'><sup>[3]</sup></a>
the Bharatavarsha of the Hindus, the Indo-Scythic empire of
king Bharat, son of Budha, the ancestor of the Yadu-Bhattis,
now confined to a nook of the desert.<a id='r7.1.4' /><a href='#f7.1.4' class='c013'><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It would be vain to speculate upon the first colonization of
India proper by the Rajkula, or ‘royal tribes.’ It appears to
have possessed an indigenous population prior to the races of
Surya, or Indu, though the genealogies which give the origin of
these degraded races of Kabas,<a id='r7.1.5' /><a href='#f7.1.5' class='c013'><sup>[5]</sup></a> Bhils, Meras, Gonds, etc., assert
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1171'>1171</span>that they were all from the same stem, and that their political
debasement was the effect of moral causes. But as there is no
proof of this, we must attribute the fable to the desire of the
Brahman [218] archaeologist to account for the origin of all things.
Modern inquiries into these matters have been cramped by an
erroneous and contracted view of the power of this ancient
people, and the direction of that power. It has been assumed
that the prejudices originating in Muslim conquests, which prevented
the Hindu chieftain from crossing the forbidden waters of
the Attock, and still more from “going down to the sea in ships,”
had always existed. But were it not far more difficult to part
with erroneous impressions than to receive new and correct views,
it would be apparent that the first of these restrictions is of very
recent origin, and on the other hand, that the Hindus of remote
ages possessed great naval power, by which communication must
have been maintained with the coasts of Africa,<a id='r7.1.6' /><a href='#f7.1.6' class='c013'><sup>[6]</sup></a> Arabia, and
Persia, as well as the Australian Archipelago.<a id='r7.1.7' /><a href='#f7.1.7' class='c013'><sup>[7]</sup></a> It is ridiculous,</p>

<p class='c001'>Since Mr. M. wrote, the revelation of the architectural antiquities in
these isles, consequent to British conquests, establishes the fact that they
were colonized by the Suryas, whose mythological and heroic history is
sculptured in their edifices and maintained in their writings. Nor should
we despair that similar discoveries may yet disclose the link which of yore
connected India with Egypt, and to which Ceylon was but the first stepping-stone.
That Rama possessed great naval means is beyond doubt, inherited
from his ancestor Sagara ‘the sea-king,’ twenty generations before the hero
of Lanka, which place I have long imagined to be Ethiopia; whence ancient
writers assert Egypt to have had her institutions, and that the Ethiopians
were of Indian origin. Cuvier, quoting Syncellus, even assigns the reign
of Amenophis as the epoch of the colonization of Ethiopia from India.—P.
180 of his ‘<cite>Discours</cite>,’ etc. [For early Hindu voyages to Java and the
neighbouring region see Smith, <cite>HFA</cite>, 259 ff.; <cite>BG</cite>, i. Part i. 489 ff.]]
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1172'>1172</span>with all the knowledge now in our possession, to suppose that
the Hindus always confined themselves within their gigantic
barriers, the limits of modern India. The cosmography of the
Puranas, imperfect and puerile as it is, and some of the texts of
Manu, afford abundant evidence of an intimate intercourse
between the countries from the Oxus to the Ganges; and even in
their allegories, we trace fresh streams of knowledge flowing into
India from that central region, stigmatized in latter days as the
land of the Barbarian (Mlechchha). Manu corroborates the Puranas,
from which we infer the fact that in distant ages one uniform
faith extended from Sakadvipa, the continent of the Sakae, to
the Ganges.<a id='r7.1.8' /><a href='#f7.1.8' class='c013'><sup>[8]</sup></a> These observations [219] it is necessary to premise
before we attempt, by following the tide of Yadu migration
during the lapse of thirty centuries, to trace them from Indraprastha,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1173'>1173</span>Suryapura, Mathura, Prayaga, Dwarka, Jadu-ka-dang
(the mountains of Jud), Bahra, Gajni in Zabulistan; and again
refluent into India, at Salbahana or Salpura in the Panjab,
Tanot, Derawar, Lodorva in the desert, and finally Jaisalmer,
founded in S. 1212, or <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1156.</p>

<p class='c001'>Having elsewhere descanted at length on the early history of
the Yadus,<a id='r7.1.9' /><a href='#f7.1.9' class='c013'><sup>[9]</sup></a> we may refer those who are likely to take an interest
in this discussion to that paper, and proceed at once to glean
what we can from the native annals before us, from the death of
their leader, Hari-Krishna, to the dispersion of the Yadus from
India. The bare fact of their migration altogether out of India
proper proves that the original intercourse, which conducted
Budha, the patriarch of the Yadu race, into India<a id='r7.1.10' /><a href='#f7.1.10' class='c013'><sup>[10]</sup></a> (where he
espoused Ila, a princess of the Surya race, and by whom his issue
was multiplied), was not forgotten, though fifty generations had
elapsed from the patriarchal Budha to Hari—to whom and the
chronicle we return.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Early Legends.</h4>—“Prayaga<a id='r7.1.11' /><a href='#f7.1.11' class='c013'><sup>[11]</sup></a> is the cradle of the Yadus who
are Somavansa (of the lunar race). Thence Mathura founded by
Pururavas remained for ages the seat of power. The name of
Jadon (Yadu), of whom there were fifty-six tribes,<a id='r7.1.12' /><a href='#f7.1.12' class='c013'><sup>[12]</sup></a> became
famous in the world, and of this race was the mighty Hari-Krishna,
who founded Dwarka.”</div>

<p class='c001'>The grand international conflicts amongst the “fifty-six Yadu
tribes,” at Kurukshetra, and subsequently at Dwarka, are sufficiently
known to the reader of Hindu history [220], and may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1174'>1174</span>be referred to elsewhere.<a id='r7.1.13' /><a href='#f7.1.13' class='c013'><sup>[13]</sup></a> These events are computed to have
happened about 1100 years before Christ. On the dispersion of
these races many abandoned India, and amongst these, two of the
many sons of Krishna. This deified leader of the Yadus had eight
wives, and the offspring of the first and seventh, by a singular
fate, now occupy what may be termed the outposts of Hinduism.<a id='r7.1.14' /><a href='#f7.1.14' class='c013'><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Rukmini was the senior of these wives; and the eldest of her
sons was Pradyumna, who was married to a princess of Vidarbha;
she bore him two sons, Aniruddha and Vajranabha, and from the
latter the Bhattis claim descent. Vajra had two sons, Sankhanabha
and Khira.<a id='r7.1.15' /><a href='#f7.1.15' class='c013'><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>“When the Jadons were exterminated in the conflict at
Dwarka, and Hari had gone to heaven, Vajra was on his way
from Mathura to see his father, but had only marched twenty
coss (forty miles), when he received intelligence of that event,
which had swept away his kindred. He died upon the spot, when
Nabha was elected king and returned to Mathura, but Khira
pursued his journey to Dwarka.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The thirty-six tribes of Rajputs hitherto oppressed by the
Yadus, who had long held universal dominion, now determined
to be revenged. Nabha was compelled to fly the holy city
[Dwarka]; he became prince of Marusthali in the west.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Thus far from the Bhagavat” (says the Bhatti chronicler),
and I continue the history of the Bhattis, by the Brahman Sukhdharma
of Mathura.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nabha had issue Prithibahu.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Khira had two sons, Jareja and Judhbhan.<a id='r7.1.16' /><a href='#f7.1.16' class='c013'><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>“Judhbhan was on a pilgrimage; the goddess heard his vows;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1175'>1175</span>she awoke him from his sleep, and promised whatever he desired.
‘Give me land that I may inhabit,’ said the youth; ‘Rule in
these hills,’ replied the goddess, and disappeared. When Judhbhan
awoke, and was yet pondering on the vision of the night,
a confused noise assailed him; and looking out, he discovered
that the prince of the country had just died without issue, and they
were disputing who should succeed him. The prime minister said,
‘he dreamed that a descendant of Krishna had arrived at Bahra,’<a id='r7.1.17' /><a href='#f7.1.17' class='c013'><sup>[17]</sup></a>
and proposed [221] to seek him out and invest him as their prince.
All assented, and Judhbhan was elected king. He became a great
prince, had a numerous progeny, and the place of their abode
was henceforth styled Jadu-ka-dang, ‘the mountains of Jadu.’</p>

<p class='c001'>“Prithibahu (‘the arm of the earth’), son of Nabha, prince

meet him; while the foe encamped two coss from Kunjshahr.<a id='r7.1.21' /><a href='#f7.1.21' class='c013'><sup>[21]</sup></a>
A battle ensued, in which the invader was defeated with the loss

Hindus. But the foeman rallied, and Raja Rajh, who again
encountered him, was wounded and died just as prince Gaj
returned with Hansavati, his bride, daughter of Judhbhan of the
east. In two battles the king of Khorasan was vanquished,
when he obtained an auxiliary in the king of Rum (Romi-pati),
to establish the Koran and the law of the prophet in infidel lands.
While the armies of the Asuras were thus preparing their strength,
Raja Gaj called a council of ministers. There being no stronghold
of importance, and it being impossible to stand against
numbers, it was determined to erect a fortress amidst the mountains
of the north. Having summoned his friends to his aid, he
sought counsel of the guardian goddess of his race; who [223]
foretold that the power of the Hindus was to cease, but commanded
him to erect a fort and call it Gajni. While it was
approaching completion, news came that the kings of Rum and
Khorasan were near at hand:</p>

auspicious hour; and the drum of departure sounded. That day
he marched eight coss, and encamped at Dulapar. The combined
kings advanced, but in the night the Shah of Khorasan died of
indigestion. When it was reported to the king of Rum (Shah
Sikandar Rumi) that Shah Mamrez was dead, he became alarmed
and said, ‘while we mortals have grand schemes in hand, He
above has other views for us.’ Still his army advanced like
waves of the ocean; caparisons and chains clank on the backs of

Elephants move like walking mountains; the sky is black with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1179'>1179</span>clouds of dust; bright helms reflect the rays of the sun. Four
coss (eight miles) separated the hostile armies. Raja Gaj and

in their rear, advanced to the combat. Each host rushed on like
famished tigers; the earth trembled; the heavens were overcast;
nor was aught visible in the gloom but the radiant helm. War-bells
resound; horses neigh; masses of men advance on each
other, like the dark rolling clouds of Bhadon. Hissing speeds the
feathered dart; the lion roar of the warriors is re-echoed; the
edge of the sword deluges the ground with blood; on both sides
the blows resound on the crackling bones. Here was Judhrae,
there the Khans and Amirs, as if Time had encountered his
fellow. Mighty warriors strew the earth; heroes fall in the cause
of their lords. The army of the Shah fled; he left twenty-five
thousand souls entangled in the net of destruction; he abandoned
elephants and horses, and even his throne. Seven thousand
Hindus lay dead on the field. The drum of victory resounded,
and the Jadon returned triumphant to his capital [224].</p>

The king sent the Tak with a party of troops, and surrounded the
house of Sridhar, who was carried before the king, who swore
he would put all his family to death if he did not produce the
young princes of Salbahana. The alarmed banker protested he
had no children of the Raja’s, for that the infants who enjoyed
his protection were the offspring of a Bhumia, who had fled, on
the invasion, deeply in his debt. But the king ordered him to
produce them; he demanded the name of the village, sent for
the Bhumias belonging to it, and not only made the royal infants
of Salbahana eat with them, but marry their daughters. The
banker had no alternative to save their lives but to consent:
they were brought forth in the peasant’s garb, ate with the
husbandmen (Jats), and were married to their daughters. Thus
the offspring of Kalarrae became the Kalhora Jats; those of
Mundraj and Sheoraj, the Mudna and Seora Jats; while the
younger boys, Phul and Kewala, who were passed off as a barber

explanation, subjoined as we proceeded, will render fewer remarks
requisite, since with their help the reader may draw his own
conclusions as to the value of this portion of the Bhatti annals,
which may be divided into four distinct epochs:</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Recapitulation of Bhatti History.</h4>—1. That of Hari, the ancestor
of the Yadu race.</div>

<p class='c001'>2. Their expulsion, or the voluntary abandonment of India
by his children, with their relations of the Harikula and Pandu
races, for the countries west of the Indus; their settlements in
Marusthali; the founding of Gajni, and combats with the kings
of Rum and Khorasan.</p>

<p class='c001'>3. Their expulsion from Zabulistan, colonization of the Panjab,
and creation of the new capital of Salbahanpur.</p>

<p class='c001'>4. Their expulsion from the Panjab, and settlement in Mer,
the rocky oasis of Maru, to the erection of Tanot.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is the more unnecessary to enter into greater details on these
outlines of the early Yadu history, since the subject has been in
part treated elsewhere.<a id='r7.1.62' /><a href='#f7.1.62' class='c013'><sup>[62]</sup></a> A multiplicity of scattered facts and
geographical distinctions fully warrants our assent to the general
truth of these records, which prove that the Yadu race had
dominion in central Asia, and were again, as Islamism advanced,
repelled upon India. The obscure legend of their encounters
with the allied Syrian and Bactrian kings would have seemed
altogether illusory, did not evidence exist that Antiochus the
Great was slain in these very regions by an Indo-Scythian prince,
called by the Greek writers Sophagasenas: a name in all probability
compounded from Subahu and his grandson Gaj (who
might have used the common affix of <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>sena</em></span>), the Yadu princes of
Gajni, who are both stated to have had conflicts with the Bactrian
(Khorasan) kings.</p>

Yadus; for the Sind-Samma dynasty was descended from Samba
(which like Yadu became a patronymic)—of which the Greeks
made Sambos—and one of whose descendants opposed Alexander
in his progress down the Indus. The capital of this dynasty was
Samma-ka-kot, or Samanagari, yet existing on the lower Indus,
and which was corrupted into Minnagara by the Greeks [231].<a id='r7.1.64' /><a href='#f7.1.64' class='c013'><sup>[64]</sup></a></p>

manner, Bappa, the ancestor of the Ranas of Mewar, abandoned
Central India after establishing his line in Chitor, and retired to
Khorasan. All this proves that Hinduism prevailed in these
distant regions, and that the intercourse was unrestricted between
Central Asia and India. We have undiscovered fields of inquiry
in Transoxiana, and in the still more accessible region of the
Panjab, where much exists to reward the archaeologist; Salbahanpur,
Kampilanagari, Bahra, the hill of Jud, perhaps Bucephalia,<a id='r7.1.66' /><a href='#f7.1.66' class='c013'><sup>[66]</sup></a>

the Hindus into seven <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>dwipas</em></span>, or continents: one of these is “Sakadvipa,
whose inhabitants, descended from Bhavya, are termed Sakeswara (<em>i.e.</em>
Sakae-lords).” His (Bhavya’s) offspring or descendants were Jalad,
Sukamara, Manivaka, Kusumada, Mandaki, Mahadruma, each of whom
gave his name to a <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>khand</em></span>, or division (<em>qu.</em> Sukmarkhand?). The chief
ranges of mountains were Jaldas, Raivat, Syama, Indak, Amki, Rim, and
Kesari. “There were seven grand rivers, namely, Mag, Magad, Arvarna,
etc. The inhabitants worship the sun.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Slight as this information is, we must believe that this Sakadvipa or
Sakatai is the Scythia of the Ancients; and the Sakeswara (the Sakas of
Manu), the Sakae so well known to western history, the progenitors of the
Parthians, whose first (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>adi</em></span>) king was Arsaka. The sun-worship indicates
the adorer of Mithras, the Mitra or Surya of the Hindu; the Arvarna recalls
the Araxes applied to the Jaxartes; while Jalad, the proper name of the
son of the first king of Sakadvipa, appears to be the Yulduz of the Tatar
historian Abulghazi, who uses the same term as does the Hindu, to designate
a range of mountains. Whence this identity between Puranic and Tatar
cosmography? [These speculations possess no value.]</p>

<p class='c001'>“A chief of the twice-born tribe (<em>i.e.</em> Brahmans) was brought by Vishnu’s
eagle from Sakadvipa, and thus have Sakadvipa Brahmans become known
in Jambudwipa” (India). Mr. Colebrooke on Indian Classes, <cite>Asiatic
Researches</cite>, vol. v. p. 53. And Manu says that it was only on their ceasing
to sanction Brahmans residing amongst them, that the inhabitants of these
remote western regions became ‘Mlechchha,’ or barbarians: testimonies
which must be held conclusive of perfect intercourse and reciprocity of
sentiment between the nations of Central Asia and India at periods the most
remote.</p>

carried on the lunar (Indu) races in India.” Now this Ayu is likewise the
patriarch of the Tatars, and in that language signifies the moon, a male
divinity both with Tatars and Rajputs. Throughout there are traces of an
original identity, which justifies the application of the term Indo-Scythic

<p class='c001'><a href='#r7.1.17'>17</a>. The precise knowledge of the topography of these regions, displayed
in the Bhatti annals, is the most satisfactory proof of their authenticity. In
the present day, it would be in vain to ask any native of Jaisalmer the
position of the “hill of Jud,” or the site of Bahra; and but for the valuable
translation of Babur’s <cite>Memoirs</cite>, by Mr. Erskine, we should have been unable
to adduce the following testimony. Babur crossed the Indus the 17th
February 1519, and on the 19th, between that river and one of its great
towns, the Behat, he reached the very tract where the descendant of Krishna
established himself twenty-five centuries before. Babur says, “Seven kos
from Behreh to the north there is a hill. This hill in the Zefer Nameh
(History of Timoor), and other books, is called the Hill of Jud. At first I
was ignorant of the origin of its name, but afterwards discovered that in
this hill there were two races of men descended of the same father. One
tribe is called Jud, the other Jenjuheh. From old times they have been the
rulers and lords of the inhabitants of this hill, and of the Ils and Uluses
(political divisions) between Nilab and Behreh. Their power is exerted in
a friendly and brotherly way. They cannot take from them whatever they
please. They take as their share a portion that has been fixed from very
remote times. The Jud is divided into various branches or families, as
well as the Jenjuheh. The chief man amongst them gets the name of Rae.”—Erskine’s
<cite>Baber</cite>, p. 254.</p>

<p class='c001'>Here is a decided confirmation that this Hindu colony preserved all their
original manners and customs even to Babur’s day. The tribe of Janjuhahs,
beyond a doubt, is the tribe of Johya, so celebrated in the region skirting
the Sutlej, and which will be noticed hereafter. I presented a small work
entirely relating to their history to the Royal Asiatic Society. As Babur
says they are of the same family as the Juds, they are probably the descendants
of Janj, the brother of Bhatti, who changed the family patronymic
from Jadu or Judu to Bhatti; and thus it appears that when the elder
branch was driven from Gajni, they retreated amongst their relations of
the hills of Jud. Babur was quite enamoured with the beauty of the hill
of Jud, which, with its lake and valleys, he describes as a miniature Kashmir.—P.

<div class='footnote' id='f7.1.20'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r7.1.20'>20</a>. In this early portion of the annals there is a singular mixture of historical
facts, and it appears that the Yadu scribes confound their connexions with
the Syrian and Bactrian Greeks, and with the first Muslim conquerors.
Imperfect as is this notice of Subahu, his son Rajh, and grandson Gaj, who
were thus assailed by Farid of Khorasan (Bactria), and his auxiliary, the
king of Rum (Syria), we have a powerful allusion to Antiochus the Great,
who, two hundred and four years before Christ, invaded Bactria and India.
Amongst the few facts left of this expedition is his treaty with Sophagasenas,
the Indian monarch, in which the Syrian king stipulated for a tribute in
elephants. There are, even in this medley of incidents, grounds for imagining
that Sophagasenas is the Yadu prince of Gajni. Whether, out of
Subahu and Gaj, the Greeks manufactured their Sophagasenas, or whether
prince Gaj could have been entitled Subhagsen, in compliment to his mother,
Subhag-Sundari, of Malwa, must be left for the speculative to decide. It
is not unlikely that the nature of the tribute, said to have been elephants,
which the Indian agreed to furnish to the Greek prince, may have originated
with the name of <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>Gaj</em></span>, which means ‘elephant.’ [Sophagasenas, mentioned
by Polybius (xi. 34) was probably an Indian king, Subhāgasena, who ruled
in the Kābul valley.]</p>

<p class='c001'>There is at the same time much that refers to the early progress of Islam
in these regions of Central Asia. Price, in his excellent history, extracting
from the Khulasatu-l-Akhbar, says, “Hejauge was entrusted with the
government of Khorasan, and Obaidoolah with Seistan, who had orders
from Hejauge, his superior, to invade Caubul, whose prince was Reteil or
Retpeil, whom the Author supposes either a Tatar or Hindoo prince. Artfully
retiring, he drew the Mohamedan army into the defiles, and blocking
up the rear, cut off their retreat, and Obaidoolah was compelled to purchase
his liberation by the payment of seven hundred thousand dirhems.” [See
Elliot-Dowson ii. 417; “Retpeil” is possibly Ratnapāla.]</p>

<p class='c001'>This was the seventy-eighth year of the Hegira, or <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 697. Conjoined
to what follows, it appears to have reference to Rajh, father of Gaj. Again,</p>

<p class='c001'>“Obaidoolah and Abdoorehman invaded Seistan with forty thousand
men. The prince of Caubul tried the same man&oelig;uvre, but was outwitted
by the Mohamedan, who conquered a great part of Caubul and acquired
great booty, with which he returned to Seistan, to the great displeasure of
Hejauge; and Abdoorehman entered into a confederacy with Retpeil to
attack Hejauge, and absolve Caubul from tribute. Moghairah was the
successor of Abdoorehman in Khorasan, while his father, Mohilel, was
employed beyond the Jehoon, but died at Meru of a burning diarrhoea,
bequeathing his government to Yezzid.”</p>

<p class='c001'>This account of Mughaira’s (the governor of Khorasan) death, while
carrying on war against the Hindu “Retpeil” of Kabul, has much analogy
to the sudden death of Mamrez, the foe of Rajh of Zabulistan. One thing
is now proved, that princes of the Hindu faith ruled over all these regions
in the first ages of Islamism, and made frequent attempts, for centuries
after, to reconquer them. Of this fact, Babur gives us a most striking
instance in his description of Gajni, or, as he writes, Ghazni. He says, “I
have seen, in another history, that when the Rai of Hind besieged Subaktegin
in Ghazni, Subaktegin ordered dead flesh and other impurities to be thrown
into the fountain, when there instantly arose a tempest and hurricane, with
rain and snow, and by this device he drove away the enemy.” Babur adds,
“I made then inquiry in Ghazni for this well, but nobody could give me the
slightest information regarding it” (p. 150). Doubtless, when Babur conquered
India, and became better acquainted with the Hindu warriors, he
would have got to the bottom of this anecdote, and have seen that the
success of the ruse of Sabuktegin arose out of the religion of his foes, who
could not use water thus contaminated by the flesh of the sacred kine. The
celebrated Valabhi was reduced by the same stratagem.</p>

of Salbahana in the Panjab, by the fugitive Yadu prince from Gajni. Of its
exact position we have no means of judging, but it could not have been
remote from Lahore. It may be deemed a fortunate coincidence that I
should discover that ancient inscription (p. <a href='#Page_914'>914</a>) of this capital, styled
Salpur, governed by a Gete or Jat in the fourth century; which suggested
the idea (which many facts tend to prove), whether these Yadus (whose
illegitimate issue, as will appear in the sequel, are called Jats) may not be
the Yuti or Getes from Central Asia. The coincidence of the date of Salbahan-Yadu
with that of the Saka Salivahan, the Tak, will not fail to strike
the inquirer into Hindu antiquities: and it is not the least curious circumstance,
that these Yadus, or Yuti, displaced the Takshak, or Tak, from
this region, as will appear immediately. In further corroboration, see notes

are to place any faith in the chronology of the Tuar race, no prince of this
family could be synchronous with the Yadu Salbahan. I am inclined to
think that the emigration of Salbahan’s ancestors from Gajni was at a much
later period than S. 72, as I shall note as we proceed. [As will be seen later

<p class='c001'><a href='#r7.1.36'>36</a>. However curious this assertion, of the Chagatais being descended from

which may be termed Hinduism.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f7.1.37'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r7.1.37'>37</a>. As it is evident the period has reference to the very first years of
Islamism, and it is stated that the sons of Gaj were to be proselytes, it is by
no means improbable that this is Jaipal, the infidel prince of Khwarizm.—See
Price’s <cite>Mahomedan History</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f7.1.38'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r7.1.38'>38</a>. This is a most important admission of the proselytism of the ancient
Indo-Scythic Yadu princes to the faith of Islam, though there can be no
reasonable doubt of it. Temugin, better known by his <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>nomme de guerre</em></span>,
Jangiz, the father of Chagatai, according to the Muhammadan historians, is
termed an infidel, and so was Takash, the father of Muhammad of Khwarizm:
the one was of the Getic or Yuti race; the other, as his name discloses, of
the Tak or Takshak, the two grand races of Central Asia. The insertion of
this pedigree in this place completely vitiates chronology; yet for what
purpose it could have been interpolated, if not founded on some fact, we
cannot surmise.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f7.1.40'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r7.1.40'>40</a>. It has already been stated that the fifteen brothers of Baland established
themselves in the mountainous parts of the Panjab, and that his
sons inherited those west of the Indus, or Daman. The Afghan tribes,
whose supposed genealogy from the Jews has excited so much curiosity, and
who now inhabit the regions conquered by the sons of Salbahan, are possibly
Yadus, who, on conversion, to give more éclat to their antiquity, converted
Yadu into Yahudi or Jew, and added the rest of the story from the Koran.
That grand division of Afghans called the Yusufzai, or ‘Sons of Joseph,’
whose original country was Kabul and Ghazni, yet retain the name of
Jadon (vulgar of Yadu) as one of their principal subdivisions; and they
still occupy a position in the hilly region east of the Indus, conquered by
the sons of Baland. It would be a curious fact could we prove the Afghans
not Yahudis but Yadus [?].</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f7.1.41'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r7.1.41'>41</a>. Doubtless the junction of Janj with that of Johya, another numerous
tribe, formed the Janjuha of Babur; the Johyas of the Bhatti annals, now

been great between the two cities. There is a Sangala, south of Lahore,
near the altars of Alexander, and a Sialkot in our modern maps. Salbahana,
Salbahanpur, or simply Salpura, may have been erected on the ruins of
Kampilanagari. We may hope that researches in that yet untouched
region, the Panjab, will afford much to the elucidation of ancient history.

<div class='footnote' id='f7.1.48'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r7.1.48'>48</a>. This incidental mention of the race of Tak, and of its being in great
consideration on the settlement of the Yadus in the Panjab, is very important.
I have given a sketch of this tribe (Vol. I. p. <a href='http://www.gutenberg.org/files/57374/57374-h/57374-h.htm#Page_123'>123</a>), but since I wrote it I have
discovered the capital of the Tak, and on the very spot where I should have
expected the site of Taxila, the capital of Taxiles, the friend of Alexander.
In that sketch I hesitated not to say that the name was not personal, but
arose from his being the head of the Takshak or Naga tribe, which is confirmed.
It is to Babur, or rather to his translator, that I am indebted for
this discovery. In describing the limits of Banu, Babur thus mentions it:
“And on the west is Dasht, which is also called Bazar and Tak”; to which
the erudite translator adds, “Tak is said long to have been the capital of
Daman.” In Mr. Elphinstone’s map, Bazar, which Babur makes identical
with Tak, is a few miles north of the city of Attok. There is no question
that both the river and city were named after the race of Tak or Takshak,
the Nagas, Nagvansi, or snake race, who spread over India. Indeed, I
would assume that the name of Omphis, which young Taxiles had on his
father’s death, is Ophis, the Greek version of Tak, the ‘serpent.’ The Taks
appear to have been established in the same regions at the earliest period.
The Mahabharata describes the wars between Janamejaya and the Takshaks,
to revenge on their king the death of his father Parikshit, emperor of Indraprastha,
or Delhi. [These theories have no foundation. Omphis is the
Greek form of Skt. Āmbhi, and has no connexion with a snake cult (Smith,

mass of fiction. “We are told that Sālivāhan founded the city of Sālbāhanpur
in Vikrama Sambat 72, or about <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 16; that the third in succession
to him, Mangal Rāo, was driven southward into the desert, and that Mangal
Rāo’s grandson, Kehar, laid the foundations of a castle called Tanot (still
in Jaisalmer territory), which was completed in <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 731; or, in other words,
that Sālivāhan and his five immediate successors reigned for more than
seven hundred years. Again, it is said that in Sālivāhan’s time the coconut,
an offer of marriage, came from Rāja Jaipāl Tonwar of Delhi, whereas the
Tonwar dynasty ruled at Delhi for just a century from about <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1050.”
This Sālivāhana cannot be the hero who is said to have conquered the Indo-Scythians,
but some of the many legends connected with him may have
suggested the fictions of the Bhatti bards (Erskine iii. A. 96).]</p>

had two sons, Rana and Giga; the first of whom had five sons, Dhukur,
Pohor, Budh, Kulru, Jaipal, all of whom had issue, and became heads of
clans. The descendants of Giga bore the name of Khengar (<em>qu.</em> chiefs of
Girnar?). The annals of all these States abound with similar minute
genealogical details, which to the Rajputs are of the highest importance in
enabling them to trace the affinities of families, but which it is imperative
to omit, as they possess no interest for the European reader. I have
extracted the names of the issue of Mulraj to show this. The Khengars
were famed in the peninsula of Surashtra—nine of them ruled in Junagarh
Girnar; and but for this incidental relation, their origin must have ever
remained concealed from the archaeologist, as the race has long been extinct.
On some future day I hope to present a sketch of Khengar’s palace, on the
sacred mount Girnar, to the public. [The famous well, at least, is attributed

whose kingdom extended north to Kashmir, and south to the ocean; and
the Azour of D’Anville, who, on the authority of Ebn Haukal, says, “Azour
est presque comparable à Multan pour la grandeur.” He adds, that Azizi
places it “trente parasanges de Mansora.” If Mansura is the ancient

such terms as the Panjnad, and the ancient Aror, stamps these annals with
authenticity, however they may be deformed by the interpolations and
anachronisms of ignorant copyists. Of Aror, or the Panjnad, excepting
the regular kasids, or messengers, perhaps not an individual living in

other S. 787. Either names are wanting, or the period of Salbahan is
erroneous. Kehar’s period, namely, S. 787, appears a landmark, and is
borne out by numerous subsequent most valuable synchronisms. Were we
to admit one hundred years to have elapsed between Salbahan and Kehar,
it would make the period of expulsion from Zabulistan about S. 687, which
is just about the era of Muhammad.</p>

the territory of the Barahas, who [234] joined them, and there
they encamped. Tano collected his brethren around him, and
prepared for defence. During four days they defended the castle;
and on the fifth the Rao ordered the gates to be thrown open, and
with his son, Bijairae, sallied out sword in hand, and attacked the
besiegers. The Barahas were the first to fly, and they were soon
followed by the rest of the Asurs. The victors carried the spoils
of the field into Tanot. As soon as the armies of Multan and

Barahas, whom he defeated and plundered. In S. 892, he had a
son by the Buta queen, who was called Deoraj. The Barahas and
Langahas once more united to attack the Bhatti prince; but
they were defeated [235] and put to flight. Finding that they
could not succeed by open warfare, they had recourse to treachery.
Having, under pretence of terminating this long feud, invited
young Deoraj to marry the daughter of the Baraha chief, the
Bhattis attended, when Bijairae and eight hundred of his kin
and clan were massacred. Deoraj escaped to the house of the
Purohit (of the Barahas, it is presumed), whither he was pursued.
There being no hope of escape, the Brahman threw the Brahmanical
thread round the neck of the young prince, and in order to
convince his pursuers that they were deceived as to the object
of their search, he sat down to eat with him from the same dish.<a id='r7.2.19' /><a href='#f7.2.19' class='c013'><sup>[19]</sup></a>

his maternal abode, where he had the happiness to find his mother,
who had escaped the massacre at Tanot. She was rejoiced to
behold her son’s face, and “waved the salt over his head,” then
threw it into the water, exclaiming, “Thus may your enemies
melt away!” Soon tired of a life of dependence, Deoraj asked
for a single village, which was promised; but the kin of the Buta
chief alarmed him, and he recalled it, and limited his grant to
such a quantity of land as he could encompass by the thongs cut
from a single buffalo’s hide; and this, too, in the depth of the
desert. For this expedient he was indebted to the architect
Kaikeya, who had constructed the castle of Bhatner.<a id='r7.2.20' /><a href='#f7.2.20' class='c013'><sup>[20]</sup></a> Deoraj

the 5th of the month Magh (sudi), the Pushya Nakshatra, S. 909.</div>

<p class='c001'>Soon as the Buta chief heard that his son-in-law was erecting,
not a dwelling, but a castle, he sent a force to raze it. Deoraj
despatched his mother with the keys to the assailants, and invited
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1196'>1196</span>the leaders to receive the castle and his homage; when the chief
men, to the number of a hundred and twenty, entered, they
were inveigled, under pretence of consultation, ten at a time, and
each party put to death and their bodies thrown over the wall.
Deprived of their leaders, the rest took to flight.</p>

<p class='c001'>Soon after, the prince was visited by his patron, the Jogi who
had protected him amongst the Barahas, and who now gave him
the title of Siddh.<a id='r7.2.22' /><a href='#f7.2.22' class='c013'><sup>[22]</sup></a> This Jogi, who possessed the art of transmuting
metals, lodged in the same house where Deoraj found protection
on the massacre of his father and kindred. One day, the holy
man had gone abroad, leaving his jarjarikakantha, or ‘tattered
doublet,’ in which was the Raskumbha, or ‘elixir-vessel,’ a drop
of which having fallen on the dagger of Deoraj and changed it to
gold, he decamped with both, and it was by the possession of this
he was enabled to erect Derawar. The Jogi was well aware of
the thief whom he now came to visit; and he confirmed him in
the possession of the stolen property, on one condition, that he
should become his chela and disciple, and, as a token of submission
and fidelity, adopt the external symbols of the Jogi. Deoraj
assented, and was invested with the Jogi robe of ochre.<a id='r7.2.23' /><a href='#f7.2.23' class='c013'><sup>[23]</sup></a> He
placed the mudra<a id='r7.2.24' /><a href='#f7.2.24' class='c013'><sup>[24]</sup></a> in his ear, the little horn round his neck, and
[237] the bandage (langota) about his loins; and with the gourd
(khopra) in his hand, he perambulated the dwellings of his kin,
exclaiming, Alakh! Alakh!<a id='r7.2.25' /><a href='#f7.2.25' class='c013'><sup>[25]</sup></a> The gourd was filled with gold

the tika was made on his forehead; and exacting a pledge that
these rites of inauguration should be continued to the latest
posterity, the Baba Rata (for such was the Jogi’s name) disappeared.</p>

<p class='c001'>Deoraj determined to wreak his revenge on the Barahas, and
he enjoyed it even “to stripping the scarfs from the heads of
their females.” On his return to Derawar, he prepared for an
attack on Langaha, the heir of which was then on a marriage
expedition at Alipur. There, Deoraj attacked and slew a thousand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1197'>1197</span>of them, the rest henceforth acknowledged his supremacy. The
Langahas were gallant Rajputs.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Langāha Tribe.</h4>—As the tribe of Langaha, or Langa, will
from this period go hand in hand, in all the international wars of
the Yadu-Bhattis, from their expulsion from the Panjab to their
final settlement in the Indian desert, it is of some interest to trace
its origin and destiny. It is distinctly stated that, at this epoch,
the Langahas were Rajputs; and they are in fact a subdivision
of the Solanki or Chalukya race, one of the four Agnikula; and
it is important to observe that in their gotracharya, or ‘genealogical
tree,’ they claim Lohkot in the Panjab as their early
location; in all probability prior to their regeneration on Mount
Abu, when they adopted Brahmanical principles. From the
year S. 787 (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 731), when the castle of Tanot was erected by
the leader of the Bhatti colony, down to S. 1530 (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1474), a
period of seven hundred and forty-three years, perpetual border-strife
appears to have occurred between the Bhattis and Langahas,
which terminated in that singular combat, or duel, of tribe against
tribe, during the reign of Rawal Chachak, in the last-mentioned
period. Shortly after this, Babur conquered India, and Multan
became a province of the empire, when the authority of tribes
ceased. Ferishta, however, comes to our aid and gives us an
account of an entire dynasty of this tribe as kings of Multan.
The first of this line of five kings began his reign <span class='fss'>A.H.</span> 847 (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span>
1443), or thirty years anterior to the death of Rawal Chachak.
The Muslim historian (see Briggs’ Ferishta, vol. iv. p. 379) says
that when Khizr Khan Sayyid<a id='r7.2.27' /><a href='#f7.2.27' class='c013'><sup>[27]</sup></a> was emperor of Delhi, he sent
Shaikh Yusuf as his lieutenant to Multan, who gained the esteem
of the surrounding princes; amongst whom was Rae Sahra, chief
of Sivi, head of the tribe of Langaha [238], who came to congratulate
him, and to offer his services and a daughter in marriage.
The offer was accepted; constant communication was kept up
between Sivi and Multan, till at length Rae Sahra disclosed the
object of all this solicitude; he threw aside the mask, confined
the Shaikh, sent him off to Delhi, and crowned himself king of
Multan, under the title of Kutbu-d-din.</div>

<p class='c001'>Ferishta<a id='r7.2.28' /><a href='#f7.2.28' class='c013'><sup>[28]</sup></a> calls Rae <a id='corr1197.37'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Sehra'>Sahra</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_1197.37'><ins class='correction' title='Sehra'>Sahra</ins></a></span> and his tribe of Langaha, Afghans;

which are perfectly reconcilable, and by no means indicative
that the Pathan or Afghan of that early period, or even in the
time of Rae Sahra, was a Muhammadan. The title of Rae is
sufficient proof that they were even then Hindus. Mr. Elphinstone
scouts the idea of the descent of the Afghans from the Jews;
and not a trace of the Hebrew is found in the Pushtu, or language
of this tribe, although it has much affinity to the Zend and
Sanskrit. I cannot refrain from repeating my conviction of the
origin of the Afghans from the Yadu, converted into Yahudi, or
‘Jew.’ Whether these Yadus are or are not Yuti, or Getae,
remains to be proved.<a id='r7.2.29' /><a href='#f7.2.29' class='c013'><sup>[29]</sup></a></p>

The family Purohit, having been offended, took sanctuary (saran)
with Deoraj, and stimulated him to dispossess his old masters of
their territory. A marriage was proposed to Nripbhan, the chief
of the Lodras, which being accepted, Deoraj, at the head of twelve
hundred chosen horse, departed for Lodorva. The gates of the
city were thrown open as the bridegroom approached; but no
sooner had he entered with his suite, than swords were drawn,
and Deoraj made himself master of Lodorva.<a id='r7.2.31' /><a href='#f7.2.31' class='c013'><sup>[31]</sup></a> He married the

subject, swore he would not drink water until he had avenged
the insult. But he had not calculated the distance between him

Rawal Bachera had five sons, Dusaj, Singh, Bapi Rao, Ankho,

<p class='c001'>A merchant came to Lodorva with a caravan of horses, of
which there was one of a race so superior that a lakh of rupees
was fixed as his price; the breed belonged to a Pathan chief,
west of the Indus. To obtain it, Dusaj and his son Ankho put
themselves at the head of a band, crossed the Indus, slew Ghazi
Khan, the Pathan chief, and carried off his stud [241].</p>

<p class='c001'>Singh had a son, Sachharae; his son was Bala, who had two
sons, Ratan and Jaga; they attacked the Parihar prince Jagannath
of Mandor, and carried off five hundred camels: their
descendants are styled Singhrao Rajputs.</p>

<p class='c001'>Bapi Rao had two sons, Pahu and Mandan. Pahu had likewise
two, Biram and Tular, whose numerous issue were styled
the Pahu Rajputs. The Pahus issued from their abode of Bikampur,
and conquered the lands of the Johyas, as far as Devijhal;
and having made Pugal<a id='r7.2.39' /><a href='#f7.2.39' class='c013'><sup>[39]</sup></a> their capital, they dug numerous wells
in the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>thal</em></span>, which still go by the name of the Pahu wells.</p>

<p class='c001'>Near Khata, in the Nagor district of Marwar, there dwelt a
warrior of the Khichi tribe, named Jadra, who often plundered
even to the gates of Pugal, slaying many of the Jaitang Bhattis.
Dusaj prepared a kafila (‘caravan’) under pretence of making a
pilgrimage to the Ganges, invaded unawares the Khichi chief’s
territory, and slew him, with nine hundred of his men.</p>

prince of the Sodhas,<a id='r7.2.41' /><a href='#f7.2.41' class='c013'><sup>[41]</sup></a> made an incursion into his territories, which
he plundered. Dusaj having unavailingly remonstrated, reminding
him of ancient ties, he marched into Dhat, and gained a victory.
Dusaj had two sons, Jaisal and Bijairaj, and in his old age a third
son, by a Ranawat princess of the house of Mewar, called Lanja
Bijairae, who, when Dusaj died, was placed on the throne by the
nobles and civil officers of the State. Previous to his elevation,
he had espoused a daughter of Siddhraj Jai Singh, Solanki. During
the nuptial ceremonies, as the mother of the bride was marking
the forehead of the bridegroom [242] with the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>tilak</em></span>, or ‘inauguration
mark,’ she exclaimed, “My son, do thou become the portal
of the north—the barrier between us and the king, whose power
is becoming strong.”<a id='r7.2.42' /><a href='#f7.2.42' class='c013'><sup>[42]</sup></a> By the princess of Patan he had a son,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1203'>1203</span>who was named Bhojdeo, and who, by the death of his father
when he attained the age of twenty-five, became lord of Lodorva.
The other sons of Dusaj were at this time advanced in manhood,
Jaisal being thirty-five, and Bijairaj thirty-two years of age.</div>

<p class='c001'>Some years before the death of Dusaj, Raedhawal Puar, son
(or descendant) of Udayaditya of Dhar, had three daughters, one
of whom he betrothed to Jaipal (Ajaipal) Solanki, son of Siddhraj;<a id='r7.2.43' /><a href='#f7.2.43' class='c013'><sup>[43]</sup></a>
another to Bijairaj Bhatti, and the third to the Rana of Chitor.
The Bhatti prince left Lodorva for Dhar at the head of seven
hundred horse, and arrived at the same time with the Sesodia
and Solanki princes. On his return to Lodorva, he erected a
temple to Seshalinga, close to which he made a lake. By the
Puar princess he had a son named Rahar, who had two sons,
Netsi and Keksi.</p>

<p class='c001'>Bhojdeo had not long occupied the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>gaddi</em></span> of Lodorva, when his
uncle Jaisal conspired against him; but being always surrounded
by a guard of five hundred Solanki Rajputs, his person was unassailable.
At this time the prince of Patan was often engaged
with the king’s troops from Tatta. Jaisal, in pursuance of his
plan, determined to coalesce with the king, and cause an attack
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1204'>1204</span>on Patan (Anhilwara), by which alone he could hope for the
departure of the Solanki body-guard. Jaisal, with his chief kin,
escorted by two hundred horse, marched to the Panjnad, where
he saw the king of Ghor, who had just overcome the king of Tatta,<a id='r7.2.44' /><a href='#f7.2.44' class='c013'><sup>[44]</sup></a>
and placed his own garrison there [243],<a id='r7.2.45' /><a href='#f7.2.45' class='c013'><sup>[45]</sup></a> and he accompanied
him to Aror, the ancient capital of Sind. There he unfolded his
views, and having sworn allegiance to the king, he obtained a
force to dispossess his nephew of his territory. Lodorva was
encompassed, and Bhojdeo slain in its defence. In two days the
inhabitants were to carry off their effects, and on the third the
troops of Ghor were permitted the license of plunder. Lodorva
was sacked, and Karim Khan departed for Bakhar with the spoils.</p>

obtained the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>gaddi</em></span> of Lodorva; but it being open to invasion,
he sought a spot better adapted for defence, and he found one
only five coss (ten miles) from Lodorva. Upon the summit of a
rocky ridge, he discovered a Brahman, whose solitary hermitage
adjoined the fountain of Brahmsar. Having paid homage, and
disclosed the purport of his visit, the recluse related the history
of the triple-peaked hill, which overlooked his hermitage. He
said that in the Treta, or ‘silver age,’ a celebrated ascetic called
Kak, or Kaga, resided at this fountain, after whom the rivulet
which issued thence had its name of Kaga; that the Pandu
Arjun, with Hari Krishna, came there to attend a great sacrifice,
on which occasion Krishna foretold that, in some distant age, a
descendant of his should erect a town on the margin of that
rivulet, and should raise a castle on Trikuta, the triple-peaked
mount.<a id='r7.2.46' /><a href='#f7.2.46' class='c013'><sup>[46]</sup></a> While Krishna thus prophesied, it was observed to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1205'>1205</span>him by Arjun that the water was bad, when Krishna smote the
rock with his chakra (discus), whereupon a sweet spring bubbled
up, and on its margin were inscribed the prophetic stanzas which
the hermit Isal now pointed out to the Bhatti prince, who read
as follows:</div>

whose margin these lines were engraved. All that he stipulated
for himself was that the fields to the [244] westward of the castle
should retain his name, “the fields of Isal.” He foretold that
the intended castle should twice and a half times be sacked; that
rivers of blood would flow, and that for a time all would be lost
to his descendants.</p>

any grand undertaking with all these tribes), the 12th

the foundation of Jaisalmer was laid, and soon the inhabitants,
with all that was valuable, abandoned Lodorva,<a id='r7.2.47' /><a href='#f7.2.47' class='c013'><sup>[47]</sup></a> and began to
erect new habitations. Jaisal had two sons, Kelan and Salbahan.
He chose his chief ministers and advisers from the children of
Sodal, of the Pahu tribe, who became too powerful. Their old
enemies, the Ghana Rajputs, again invaded the lands of Khadal;
but they suffered for their audacity. Jaisal survived this event
five years, when he died, and was succeeded by his youngest son,
Salbahan the Second [245].</p>

whole degree further to the east, or 73° 15´. This city, so often mentioned
in the Yadu-Bhatti annals as one of their intermediate places of repose, on
their expulsion from India and migration to Central Asia, has its position
minutely pointed out by the Emperor Babur (p. 259), who, in his attack on
the hill tribes of Jats, Gujars, Ghakkars, etc., adjoining Kashmir, “expelled
Hati Guker from Behreh, on the Behut River, near the cave temples of
Gar-kotri at Bikrum,” of which the able annotator remarks, that as well as
those of But Bamian, they were probably Buddhist. Babur (p. 294) also
found the Jats masters of Sialkot, most likely the Salpur of the Inscription
(p. 916 above), conquered from a Jat prince in the twelfth century by the
Patan prince, and presumed to be the Salbahanpur founded by the fugitive
Yadu prince of Gajni [see p. <a href='#Page_1183'>1183</a> above].</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r7.2.20'>20</a>. This deception practised by the Bhatti chief to obtain land on which to
erect a fortress is not unknown in other parts of India, and in more remote
regions. Bhatner owes its name to this expedient, from the division
(<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>bantna</em></span>) of the hide. The etymology of Calcutta is the same, but should
be written Khalkata, from the cuttings of the hide (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>khal</em></span>). Byrsa, the castle
of Carthage, originates from the same story. If there existed any affinity
between the ancient Pali languages of India and the Punic or Phoenician
(as the names of its princes and their adjuncts of <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>bal</em></span> would indicate), and
the letters B and Ch were as little dissimilar in Punic as in Sanskrit, then
Byrsa would become charsa, ‘hide’ or ‘skin,’ which might have originated
the capital of the African Mauritania, as of the Indian Maruthan. Thus
Marocco may be from Maruka, of or belonging to Maru, the desert, also
probably the origin of the Merv of Iran. The term Moor may likewise be
corrupted from Mauri, an inhabitant of Maruka, while the Sahariya of our
Indian desert is the brother in name and profession of the Saracen of Arabia,
from Sahra, a desert, and zadan, to assault. The Nomadic princes of
Mauritania might therefore be the Pali or shepherd kings of Maruthan, the
great African desert. And who were these Philita or Pali kings of Barbary
and Egypt? It is well known that the Berbers who inhabited Abyssinia
and the south coast of the Red Sea, migrated to the northern coast, not only
occupying it, as well as Mount Atlas, but pushing their tribes far into the
grand <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>sahra</em></span>, or desert. To those colonists, that coast owes its name of
Barbary. From the days of Solomon and his contemporary Shishak, an
intimate communication subsisted between the eastern coast of Africa and
India; and I have already hazarded the opinion, that we must look to this
coast of Aethiopia and Abyssinia for the Lanka of the Rameses (Rameswar)
of India; and from the former country the most skilful archaeologists assert
that Egypt had her mythology, and more especially that mystery—the
prominent feature of both systems—the Phallic rites, or worship of the
lingam. Berber, according to Bruce, means a shepherd, and as <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>ber</em></span> is a
sheep in the language of India, Berber is a shepherd in the most literal
sense, and consequently the synonym of Pali. It has been asserted that
this race colonized these coasts of Africa from India about the time of
Amenophis, and that they are the Hyksos, or ‘shepherd-kings,’ who subjugated
Egypt. On this account a comparison of the ancient architectural
remains of Abyssinia and Aethiopia with those of the ancient Hindus is
most desirable. It is asserted, and with appearance of truth, that the
architecture of the Pyramids is distinct from the Pharaonic, and that they
are at once Astronomic and Phallic. In India, the symbolic pinnacle
surmounting the temples of the sun-god are always pyramidal. If the
forthcoming history of the Berbers should reveal the mystery of their first
settlements in Abyssinia, a great object would be attained; and if search
were made in the old cave-temples of that coast, some remains of the characters
they used might aid in tracing their analogy to the ancient Pali of
the East; an idea suggested by an examination of the few characters found
in the grand desert inhabited by the Tuaregs, which have a certain resemblance
to the Punic, and to the unknown characters attributed to the Indo-Scythic
tribes of India, as on their coins and cave-temples. Wide asunder
as are these regions, the mind that will strive to lessen the historical separation
may one day be successful, when the connexion between Aethiopia
(<em>qu.</em> from <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>aditya</em></span> and contracted <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>ait</em></span>, the Sun?) and Surashtra, ‘the land of
the Sun,’ or Syria of India, may become more tangible. Ferishta (<em>vide</em>
Briggs’ translation, vol. iv. p. 402), quoting original authorities, says, “the
inhabitants of Selandip, or the island of Ceylon, were accustomed to send
vessels to the coast of Africa, to the Red Sea, and Persian Gulf, from the
earliest ages, and Hindu pilgrims resorted to Mecca and Egypt for the
purpose of paying adoration to the idols. It is related also that this people
trading from Ceylon became converts to the true faith at so early a period
as the first caliphs”; all which confirms the fact of early intercourse between
Egypt and India.—See Vol. II. p. <a href='#Page_702'>702</a>. [It is unnecessary to criticize in
detail the etymologies suggested in this note, a good instance of the Author’s
manner. The etymology of Calcutta is unknown, the most recent suggestion
being that it is <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>Khālkata</em></span>, ‘a place where a flood cut a creek’ (Yule, <cite>Hobson-Jobson</cite>,
2nd ed. 146; Hoernle, <cite>JASB</cite>, 1898, p. 48 f.; K. Blechynden,
<cite>Calcutta Past and Present</cite>, 1905, p. 5). Bhatner means ‘city of the Bhattis.’
Berber is either Greek  βάρβαροι, or a tribal term, Barabara; that of
Aethiopia is unknown (<cite>EB</cite>, 11th ed. iii. 764, ix. 845). The story of fixing
the limits of a territory by riding round it or by encircling it with strips of
hide, as in the story of Carthage, is common in India (Bradley-Birt, <cite>Chota
Nagpore</cite>, 16 f.; Brett, <cite>Chhattisgarh Gazetteer</cite>, i. 192; <cite>BG</cite>, xiii. Part i. 169, and

Many towns throughout the desert were formerly of celebrity, but are now

married Balabhsen’s daughter in S. 1067, and he died in S. 1100; so that
it should be either S. 1055 or 1065. It is important to clear this point, as
Rawal Bachera was the opponent of Mahmud of Ghazni in his invasion of
India, <span class='fss'>A.H.</span> 303, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1000, = S. 1056 or S. 1066, the Samvat era being liable
to a variation of ten years (Colebrooke). If we are right, a passage of
Ferishta, which has puzzled the translators, should run thus: “Mahmud
directed his march against the Bhatti, and passing Multan arrived at
Bahra, a Bhatti city.”—Compare Dow, vol. i. p. 39 (2nd ed.), and Briggs,

from Kherdhar occurred about a century after that period, according to the
documents in the Rao’s family. And we have only to look at the opening
of the Annals of Marwar to see that from its colonization by the Rathors the
Gohil community of Kherdhar was finally extinguished. To the general
historian these minute facts may be unimportant, but they cease to be so
when they prove the character of these annals for fidelity.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f7.2.41'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r7.2.41'>41</a>. If this is the Hamira alluded to in the Annals of Bikaner, in whose
time the Ghaggar River ceased to flow in these lands, we have another
date assigned to a fact of great physical importance.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f7.2.42'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r7.2.42'>42</a>. Here we have another synchronism. In the Kumarpal Charitra, or
history of the kings of Anhilwara Patan, the reign of Siddhraj was from
S. 1150 to S. 1201, or <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1094 to 1145 [1094-1143]; the point of time
intermediate between the invasion of Mahmud of Ghazni and the final
conquest of India by Shihabu-d-din, during which there were many irruptions
into India by the lieutenants of the monarchs of Ghazni. There was
one in the reign of Masud, in <span class='fss'>A.H.</span> 492 (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1098), four years after the
accession of Siddhraj; another in <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1120, in the reign of Bairam Shah,
during which, according to Ferishta, the Ghaznevide general, Balin, rebelled
and assailed the Hindu Rajas from Nagor, where he established himself.
[His real name was Muhammad Bahlīm (Ferishta i. 151).] In all probability
this is the event alluded to by the queen of Patan, when she nominated the
Bhatti prince as her champion.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f7.2.43'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r7.2.43'>43</a>. [Siddharāja Jayasingha had no son, and he was succeeded by Kumārapāla;
and Ajayapāla, who succeeded in <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1174, was son of Mahipāla,
brother of Kumārapāla (<cite>BG</cite>, i. Part i. 194).] The mention of these simultaneous
intermarriages in three of the principal Rajput monarchies of that
day, namely, Dhar, Patan, and Chitor, is important, not only as establishing
fresh synchronisms, but as disclosing the intercourse between the Bhattis
and the more ancient princely families of India. The period of Udayaditya
Pramar has been established beyond cavil (see <cite>Trans. R.A.S.</cite> vol. i. p. 223),
and that of Siddhraj, likewise, whose son and successor, Ajaipal, had but a
short reign when he was deposed by Kumarpal, whose date is also found
from inscriptions. It is a singular fact that all the Rajput dynasties of
these regions were established about the same epoch, namely, Patan by the
Chawaras, Chitor by the Guhilots, Delhi, refounded by the Tuars, and the
Bhatti principality by the descendant of Salbahan. This was in the middle
of the eighth century of Vikramaditya, when the older Hindu governments
were broken up. The admission of the Bhatti to intermarry with their
families proves one of two facts: either that they were considered Rajputs,
notwithstanding their being inhabitants of the regions beyond the Indus;
or, that the families mentioned, with which they intermarried, were Indo-Scythic
like themselves.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f7.2.44'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r7.2.44'>44</a>. At every step we see, however meagre may be the outline, the correctness
of this historical sketch. It was, according to Ferishta, in <span class='fss'>A.H.</span> 555
(<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1159 [1150], or S. 1215) that the prince of Ghor conquered Ghazni, and
immediately after overran Multan and Sind (see Briggs, vol. i. p. 153); and
doubtless it was on this occasion that the Bhatti prince swore allegiance
to Shihabu-d-din, and obtained the force which drove his nephew from
Lodorva, which being sacked by his auxiliaries, he founded Jaisalmer in
S. 1212. The three years’ discrepancy between the Muhammadan and
Hindu dates is of little consequence; but even this could be remedied, when
we recollect that the Samvat, according to Mr. Colebrooke, is liable to a
variation of ten years.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f7.2.45'>

should be confirmed in our suspicion that they are a colony of the Yuti, and
that the Brahmans took advantage of the nominal resemblance to incorporate
them in the Chhattis Rajkula, or Thirty-six Royal Races.</p>

capital, Jaisalmer, in <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1156, we shall continue the sketch to

explanatory notes as we proceed.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Retrospect of Bhatti History.</h4>—The interval between the
erection of the castle of Tanot and the present time is exactly
eleven hundred years; during which the historical narrative,
whatever may be its value, is at least continuous, and the events
recorded are corroborated, even in the darkest period, by numerous
synchronisms in the annals of the other States; and viewed
synoptically, it presents matter of deep interest to the explorer
of Indian history. The period of four hundred and twenty-five
years, embraced in the preceding chapter, is full of incidents. It
is a record of a people who once deemed their consequence and
their fame imperishable. And even were it less diversified by
anecdotes descriptive of manners, it would still possess claims to
interest as a simple relation of the gradual peopling of a great
portion of the Indian desert. We see tribes and cities disappearing;
new races and new capitals taking their place; and although
not a syllable is written which [246] bears directly upon religion,
we can see, incidentally, the analogy of these Indo-Scythic tribes,
from Zabulistan and Salbahana, with the Hindu, confirming what
Manu says, that the Sakas, Yavanas, Pahlavas, and the Khasas<a id='r7.3.1' /><a href='#f7.3.1' class='c013'><sup>[1]</sup></a>
of Central Asia, were all Chhattris or Rajputs. We now proceed
with the chronicle.</div>

<p class='c001'>Jaisal, the founder of Jaisalmer, survived the change of capital
only twelve years. His elder son, Kailan, having given displeasure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1207'>1207</span>to the Pahu minister, was expelled, and his younger
brother placed upon the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>gaddi</em></span>.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Rāwal Sālivāhan I.</h4>—Salbahan, a name of celebrity in the
annals, renewed in the son of Jaisal, succeeded in S. 1224 (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span>

under their leader, Jagbhan, dwelt between the city of Jalor and
the Aravalli.<a id='r7.3.2' /><a href='#f7.3.2' class='c013'><sup>[2]</sup></a> The Kathi Rao was killed, and his horses and

Banar, and Haso.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Embassy from Badarināth.</h4>—In the mountains of Badarinath,

vacant <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>gaddi</em></span>. Haso was accordingly sent, but died just as he
arrived. His wife, who was pregnant, was taken with the pains
of labour on the journey, and was delivered of a son under the
shade of a <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>palas</em></span> tree, whence the child was called Palasia. This
infant succeeding, the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>raj</em></span> (principality) was named after him

The Rawal left Jaisalmer [247] to the care of his eldest son Bijal.
Soon after his departure, the foster-brother (Dhabhai) of the
young prince propagated the report of the Rawal’s death in an
encounter with a tiger, and prompted Bijal to assume the dignity.
Salbahan, on his return, finding his seat usurped, and having in
vain expostulated with his traitorous son, proceeded to Khadal,
of which Derawar is the capital, where he was slain, with three
hundred of his followers, in repelling an irruption of the Balochs.
Bijal did not long enjoy the dignity; having in a fit of passion
struck the Dhabhai, the blow was returned, upon which, stung
with shame and resentment, he stabbed himself with his dagger.</p>

and, after a severe engagement, slew the Baloch leader and fifteen
hundred of his men. Kailan ruled nineteen years.</p>

the tribe to take refuge with the Johyas. Soon after, the Rawal
invaded the lands of Rana Armsi, prince of the Sodhas, who,
though taken by surprise, assembled four thousand horse; but
was defeated, and forced to fly for shelter to the walls of his
capital, Umarkot. The Puar was glad to obtain the absence of
his foe by the offer of his daughter in marriage.<a id='r7.3.6' /><a href='#f7.3.6' class='c013'><sup>[6]</sup></a></div>

<p class='c001'>The Rathors, recently established in the land of Kher, had
become troublesome [248] neighbours; Chachak obtained the

Jasal and Bhalotra, where they were established; but Chhadu
and his son Thida averted his wrath by giving him a daughter
to wife.<a id='r7.3.7' /><a href='#f7.3.7' class='c013'><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Rawal Chachak ruled thirty-two years. He had only one son,

was much attached; and having convened the chiefs around his
death-bed, he entreated they would accede to his last wish, that
his youngest grandson might be his successor.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Rāwal Karan Singh I., <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1241-71.</h4>—Karan having succeeded,
his elder brother, Jethsi, abandoned his country, and took service
with the Muhammadans in Gujarat. About this time, Muzaffar
Khan, who occupied Nagor with five thousand horse, committed
great outrages. There was a Bhumia of the Baraha tribe, named
Bhagawatidas, who resided fifteen coss from Nagor, and was
master of one thousand five hundred horse. He had an only
daughter, who was demanded by the Khan, and being unwilling
to comply, and unable to resist, he resolved to abandon the
country. For this purpose he prepared carriages, in which he
placed his family and chattels, and at night proceeded towards
Jaisalmer; but the Khan, gaining intelligence of his motions,
intercepted the convoy. A battle ensued, in which four hundred
of the Barahas were killed, and his daughter and other females
were carried off. The afflicted Baraha continued his route to
Jaisalmer, and related his distress to Rawal Karan, who immediately
put himself at the head of his followers, attacked the Khan,
whom he slew, with three thousand of his people, and re-inducted
the Bhumia in his possessions. Karan ruled twenty-eight years,
and was succeeded, in S. 1327, by his son,</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Rāwal Lākhansen, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1271-75.</h4>—He was so great a simpleton,
that when the jackals howled at night, being told that it was from
being cold, he ordered quilted dresses (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>daglas</em></span>) to be prepared for
them. As the howling still continued, although he was assured
his orders had been fulfilled, he commanded houses to be built
for the animals in the royal preserves (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>ramna</em></span>), many of which yet
remain. Lakhan was the contemporary of Kanirdeo Sonigira,
whose life was saved by his (Lakhan’s) wife’s knowledge of omens.
Lakhan was ruled by this Rani, who was of the Sodha tribe. She
invited her brethren from Umarkot; but the madman, her
husband, put [249] them to death, and threw their bodies over
the walls. He was allowed to rule four years, and was then
replaced by his son,</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Rāwal Pūnpāl, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1275-76.</h4>—This prince was of a temper so
violent that the nobles dethroned him, and recalled the exiled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1211'>1211</span>Jethsi from Gujarat. Punpal had a residence assigned him in a
remote quarter of the State. He had a son, Lakamsi, who had
a son called Rao Raningdeo, who by a stratagem pointed out by
a Kharal<a id='r7.3.8' /><a href='#f7.3.8' class='c013'><sup>[8]</sup></a> Rajput, took Marot from the Johyas, and Pugal from
the Thoris, thieves by profession, whose chief, styled Rao, he
made captive; and in Pugal he settled his family. Rao Raning
had a son called Sadul, who alternately bathed in the sea of
pleasure, and struggled in that of action: to their retreat the
father and son conveyed the spoils seized from all around them.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Rāwal Jeth Singh I., <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1276-94.</h4>—Jethsi obtained the
<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>gaddi</em></span> in S. 1332 (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1276). He had two sons, Mulraj and
Ratansi. Deoraj, the son of Mulraj, espoused the daughter of
the Sonigira chief of Jalor. Muhammad [Khuni]<a id='r7.3.9' /><a href='#f7.3.9' class='c013'><sup>[9]</sup></a> Padshah
invaded the dominions of Rana Rupsi, the Parihar prince of
Mandor,<a id='r7.3.10' /><a href='#f7.3.10' class='c013'><sup>[10]</sup></a> who, when defeated, fled with his twelve daughters,
and found refuge with the Rawal, who gave him Baru<a id='r7.3.11' /><a href='#f7.3.11' class='c013'><sup>[11]</sup></a> as a
residence.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Alāu-d-din attacks Jaisalmer.</h4>—Deoraj, by his Sonigira wife,
had three sons, Janghan, Sarwan, and Hamir. This Hamir was
a mighty warrior, who attacked Kumpa Sen of Mewa,<a id='r7.3.12' /><a href='#f7.3.12' class='c013'><sup>[12]</sup></a> and
plundered his lands. He had issue three sons, Jetha, Lunkaran,
and Mairu. At this period, Ghori Alau-d-din commenced the
war against the castles of India. The tribute of Tatta and
Multan, consisting of fifteen hundred horses and fifteen hundred
mules laden with treasure and valuables, was at Bakhar in
progress to the king at Delhi. The sons of Jethsi determined to
lay an ambush and capture the tribute. Disguised as grain-merchants,
with seven thousand horse and twelve hundred
camels, they set out on their expedition, and on the banks of
the Panjnad found the convoy, escorted by four hundred Mogul
and the like number of Pathan horse. The Bhattis encamped
near the convoy; and in the night they rose upon and slew the
escort, carrying the treasure to Jaisalmer. The survivors carried
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1212'>1212</span>the news to the king, who prepared to punish this insult. When
tidings reached Rawal Jethsi that the king was encamped on the
Anasagar at Ajmer, he prepared Jaisalmer for defence. He laid
in immense stores of grain, and deposited all round the ramparts
of the fort large round stones to hurl on the besiegers. All the
aged, the infirm, and his female grandchildren were [250] removed
into the interior of the desert, while the country around
the capital for many miles was laid waste, and the towns made
desolate. The Rawal, with his two elder sons and five thousand
warriors, remained inside for the defence of the castle, while
Deoraj and Hamir formed an army to act against the enemy
from without. The sultan in person remained at Ajmer and sent
forward an immense force of Khorasanis and Kuraishes, cased in
steel armour, “who rolled on like the clouds in Bhadon.” The
fifty-six bastions were manned, and three thousand seven hundred
heroes distributed amongst them for their defence, while two
thousand remained in reserve to succour the points attacked.
During the first week that the besiegers formed their entrenchments,
seven thousand Musalmans were slain, and Mir Muhabbat
and Ali Khan remained on the field of battle. For two years the
invaders were confined to their camp by Deoraj and Hamir, who
kept the field, after cutting off their supplies, which came from
Mandor, while the garrison was abundantly furnished from
Khadal, Barmer, and Dhat. Eight years<a id='r7.3.13' /><a href='#f7.3.13' class='c013'><sup>[13]</sup></a> had the siege lasted,
when Rawal Jethsi died, and his body was burnt inside the fort.</div>

<p class='c001'>During this lengthened siege, Ratansi had formed a friendship
with the Nawab Mahbub Khan, and they had daily friendly
meetings under a khejra<a id='r7.3.14' /><a href='#f7.3.14' class='c013'><sup>[14]</sup></a> tree, between the advanced posts, each
attended by a few followers. They played at chess together,
and interchanged expressions of mutual esteem. But when
duty called them to oppose each other in arms, the whole world
was enamoured with their heroic courtesy. Jethsi had ruled
eighteen years when he died.</p>

<div class='section-start'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1213'>1213</span><h4 class='disp-inline'>Rāwal Mūlrāj III., <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1294-95.</h4>—Mulraj III., in S. 1350
(<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1294), ascended the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>gaddi</em></span> surrounded by foes. On this
occasion, the customary rejoicings on installation took place at
the moment when the two friends, Ratansi and Mahbub Khan,
had met, as usual, under the khejra tree. The cause of rejoicing
being explained to the Nawab, he observed that the Sultan had
heard of, and was offended with, these meetings, to which he
attributed the protracted defence of the castle, and acquainted
Ratansi that next day a general assault was commanded, which
he should lead in person. The attack took place; it was fierce,
but the defence was obstinate, and the assailants were beaten
back with the loss of nine thousand men. But the foe obtained
reinforcements, and towards the conclusion of the year the
garrison was reduced to the greatest privations, and the blockade
being perfect, Mulraj assembled his kinsmen and thus addressed
them: “For so many years [251] we have defended our dwellings;
but our supplies are expended, and there is no passage for more.
What is to be done?” The chiefs, Sahar and Bikamsi, replied,
“A <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>sakha</em></span> must take place; we must sacrifice ourselves”: but
that same day the royal army, unaware of the distress of the
besieged, retreated.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Sati: Johar.</h4>—The friend of Ratansi had a younger brother,
who, on the retreat of the royal forces, was carried inside the
fort, when, seeing the real state of things, he escaped and conveyed
intelligence of it, upon which the siege was renewed. Mulraj
reproached his brother as the cause of this evil, and asked what
was fit to be done? to which Ratansi replied, “There is but one
path open: to immolate the females, to destroy by fire and
water whatever is destructible, and to bury what is not; then
open wide the gates, and sword in hand rush upon the foe, and
thus attain Swarga.” The chiefs were assembled; all were
unanimous to make Jaisalnagar resplendent by their deeds, and
preserve the honour of the Jadon race. Mulraj thus replied:
“You are of a warlike race, and strong are your arms in the cause
of your prince; what heroes excel you, who thus tread in the
Chhatri’s path? In battle, not even the elephant could stand
before you. For the maintenance of my honour the sword is in
your hands; let Jaisalmer be illumined by its blows upon the
foe.” Having thus inspired the chiefs and men, Mulraj and
Ratan repaired to the palace of their queens. They told them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1214'>1214</span>to take the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>sohag</em></span>,<a id='r7.3.15' /><a href='#f7.3.15' class='c013'><sup>[15]</sup></a> and prepare to meet in heaven, while they
gave up their lives in defence of their honour and their faith.
Smiling, the Sodha Rani replied, “This night we shall prepare,
and by the morning’s light we shall be inhabitants of Swarga”
(heaven); and thus it was with the chiefs and all their wives.
The night was passed together for the last time in preparation
for the awful morn. It came; ablutions and prayers were
finished, and at the Rajdwara<a id='r7.3.16' /><a href='#f7.3.16' class='c013'><sup>[16]</sup></a> were convened <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>bala</em></span>, <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>praurha</em></span>, and
<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>briddhu</em></span>.<a id='r7.3.17' /><a href='#f7.3.17' class='c013'><sup>[17]</sup></a> They bade a last farewell to all their kin; the Johar
commenced, and twenty-four thousand females, from infancy to
old age, surrendered their lives, some by the sword, others in the
volcano of fire. Blood flowed in torrents, while the smoke of the
pyre ascended to the heavens: not one feared to die, every
valuable was consumed with them, not the worth of a straw was
preserved for the foe. This work done, the brothers looked upon
the spectacle with horror. Life was now a burden, and they
prepared to quit it. They purified themselves with water, paid
adoration to the divinity, made gifts [252] to the poor, placed a
branch of the Tulsi<a id='r7.3.18' /><a href='#f7.3.18' class='c013'><sup>[18]</sup></a> in their casques, the Salagram<a href='#f7.3.18' class='c013'><sup>[18]</sup></a> round their
neck; and having cased themselves in armour and put on the
saffron robe, they bound the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>mor</em></span><a id='r7.3.19' /><a href='#f7.3.19' class='c013'><sup>[19]</sup></a> (crown) around their heads,
and embraced each other for the last time. Thus they awaited
the hour of battle. Three thousand eight hundred warriors,
with faces red with wrath, prepared to die with their chiefs.</div>

<p class='c001'>Ratansi had two sons, named Gharsi and Kanar, the eldest
only twelve years of age. He wished to save them from the
impending havoc, and applied to his courteous foeman. The
Muslim chief swore he would protect them, and sent two confidential
servants to receive the trust; to whom, bidding them a
last farewell, their father consigned them. When they reached
the royal camp they were kindly welcomed by the Nawab, who,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1215'>1215</span>putting his hand upon their heads, soothed them, and appointed
two Brahmans to guard, feed, and instruct them.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the morrow, the army of the Sultan advanced to the
assault. The gates were thrown wide, and the fight began.
Ratan was lost in the sea of battle; but one hundred and twenty
Amirs fell before his sword ere he lay in the field. Mulraj plied
his lance on the bodies of the barbarians: the field swam in blood.
The unclean spirits were gorged with slaughter; but at length
the Jadon chief fell, with seven hundred of the choice of his kin.
With his death the battle closed; the victors ascended the castle,
and Mahbub Khan caused the bodies of the brothers to be carried
from the field and burned. The <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>sakha</em></span> took place in S. 1351, or
<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1295. Deoraj, who commanded the force in the field, was
carried off by a fever. The royal garrison kept possession of the
castle during two years, and at length blocked up the gateways,
and dismantled and abandoned the place, which remained long
deserted, for the Bhattis had neither means to repair the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>kunguras</em></span>
(battlements) nor men to defend them [253].</p>

Regia of Ptolemy [?]. [The Khosas are a Muhammadan tribe, driven from
Sind in <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1786, who lived beside the Rann of Cutch, and levied blackmail

<div class='footnote' id='f7.3.2'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r7.3.2'>2</a>. We can scarcely refuse our assent to the belief that the Kathi or
Katti tribe, here mentioned, is the remnant of the nation which so manfully
opposed Alexander. It was then located about Multan, at this period
occupied by the Langahas. The colony attacked by the Bhatti was near
the Aravalli, in all probability a predatory band from the region they
peopled and gave their name to, Kathiawar, in the Surashtra peninsula.
[The Kāthis were probably a nomadic Central Asian tribe, driven down the
valley of the Indus by the tide of early Muhammadan invasions. Their
appearance in Jaisalmer at the end of the twelfth century <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> probably
marks a stage in their southerly progress. Thence they seem to have
moved into Mālwa, thence to Cutch, and finally to Kāthiāwār (<cite>BG</cite>, ix.

<div class='footnote' id='f7.3.3'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r7.3.3'>3</a>. Mr. Elphinstone enumerates the Jadon as a subdivision of the Yusufzais,
one of the great Afghan tribes, who were originally located about
Kabul and Ghazni. I could not resist surmising the probability of the
term Jadon, applied to a subdivision of the Afghan race, originating from
the Hindu-Scythic Jadon, or Yadu; whence the boasted descent of the
Afghans from Saul, king of the Jews (Yahudis). The customs of the
Afghans would support this hypothesis: “The Afghans (says the Emperor
Babur, p. 159), when reduced to extremities in war, come into the presence
of their enemy with grass between their teeth, being as much as to say,
‘I am your ox.’” This custom is entirely Rajput, and ever recurring in
inscriptions recording victories. They have their bards or poets in like
manner, of whom Mr. Elphinstone gives an interesting account. In features,
also, they resemble the Northern Rajputs, who have generally aquiline
noses, or, as Mr. Elphinstone expresses it in the account of his journey
through the desert, “Jewish features”; though this might tempt one to
adopt the converse of my deduction, and say that these Yadus of Gajni
were, with the Afghans, also of Yahudi origin: from the lost tribes of
Israel. [The Jadūn, as Rose writes their name, are not Yūsufzais, but live
S. of them, and have no connexion with the Rājput Jādons (<cite>Glossary</cite>, ii.
272 f., iii. 254).]</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f7.3.5'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r7.3.5'>5</a>. [“If this is correct, the date of the foundation of Jaisalmer must be
wrong, for Mān Singh’s father is known to have been alive in 1249. Moreover
the Deora sept did not exist, as it took the name from Mān Singh’s son
Deoraj” (Erskine iii. A. 11).]</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f7.3.6'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r7.3.6'>6</a>. In this single passage we have revealed the tribe (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>got</em></span>), race (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>kula</em></span>),
capital, and proper name of the prince of Dhat. The Sodha tribe, as before
stated, is an important branch of the Pramara (Puar) race, and with the
Umras and Sumras gave dynasties to the valley of Sind from the most
remote period. The Sodhas, I have already observed, were probably the
Sogdoi of Alexander, occupying Upper Sind when the Macedonian descended
that stream. The Sumra dynasty is mentioned by Ferishta from ancient
authorities, but the Muhammadan historians knew nothing, and cared
nothing, about Rajput tribes. It is from such documents as these, scattered
throughout the annals of these principalities, and from the ancient Hindu
epic poems, that I have concentrated the “Sketches of the Rajput Tribes,”
introductory to the first volume, which, however slight they appear, cost
more research than the rest of the book. I write this note chiefly for the
information of the patriarch of oriental lore on the Continent, the learned
and ingenious De Sacy. If this mentor ask, “Where are now the Sodhas?”
I reply, the ex-prince of Umarkot, with whose ancestors Humayun took
refuge—in whose capital in the desert the great Akbar was born—and who
could on the spur of the moment oppose four thousand horse to invasion,
has only one single town, that of Chor, left to him. The Rathors, who, in
the time of Armsi Rana and Rawal Chachak, were hardly known in Marudes,
have their flag waving on the battlements of the ‘immortal castle’ (Amarkuta),
and the Amirs of Sind have incorporated the greater part of Dhat
with their State of Haidarabad. [Umarkot is not the ‘immortal castle,’
but the fort of Umar, chief of the Sūmra tribe (<cite>IGI</cite>, xxiv. 118).]</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f7.3.7'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r7.3.7'>7</a>. To those interested in the migration of these tribes, it must be gratifying
to see these annals thus synchronically corroborating each other. About
two centuries before this, in the reign of Dusaj, when the Bhatti capital was
at Lodorva, an attack was made on the land of Kher, then occupied by the
Guhilots, who were, as related in the Annals of Marwar, dispossessed by the
Rathors. None but an inquirer into these annals of the desert tribes can
conceive the satisfaction arising from such confirmation.</p>

years subsequent to this disastrous event in the Bhatti
annals, Jagmall, son of Maloji Rathor, chief of Mewa, attempted
a settlement amidst the ruins of Jaisalmer, and brought thither
a large force, with seven hundred carts of provisions. On hearing
this, the Bhatti chiefs, Dudu and Tilaksi, the sons of Jaisar,
assembled their kinsmen, surprised the Rathors, drove them
from the castle, and captured the supplies. Dudu, for this
exploit, was elected Rawal, and commenced the repairs of Jaisalmer.
He had five sons. Tilaksi, his brother, was renowned for
his exploits. He despoiled the Baloch, the Mangalea, the Meawa,
and the Deoras and Sonagiras of Abu and Jalor felt his power.
He even extended his raids to Ajmer, and carried off the stud of
Firoz Shah from the Anasagar (lake), where they were accustomed

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Gharsi Rāwal, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1306-35. Jaisalmer restored.</h4>—On the
death of Rawal Dudu, in S. 1362 (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1306), the young princes,
Gharsi and Kanar, by the death of their patron Mahbub, were
left to the protection of his sons, Zulfikar and Ghazi Khan.
Kanar went privately to Jaisalmer, and Gharsi obtained leave to
proceed westward to the Mewa tract, where he married Bimaladevi,
a widow, sister to the Rathor, who had been betrothed<a id='r7.4.3' /><a href='#f7.4.3' class='c013'><sup>[3]</sup></a> to
the Deora. While engaged in these nuptials, he was visited by
his relation Soningdeo, a man of gigantic strength, who agreed
to accompany him on his return to Delhi. The king made trial
of his force, by giving him to string an iron bow sent by the king
of Khorasan, which the nervous Bhatti not only bent but broke.
The invasion of Delhi by Timur Shah<a id='r7.4.4' /><a href='#f7.4.4' class='c013'><sup>[4]</sup></a> having occurred at this
time, the services of Gharsi were so conspicuous that he obtained
a grant of his hereditary dominions, with permission to re-establish
Jaisalmer. With his own kindred, and the aid of the vassals of
his friend Jagmall of Mewa, he soon.restored order, and had an
efficient force at command. Hamir and his clansmen gave their
allegiance to Gharsi, but the sons of Jaisar were headstrong.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Adoption of Kehar. Rāwal Gharsi assassinated.</h4>—Deoraj,
who married the daughter of Rupra, Rana of Mandor, had a son
named Kehar, who, when Jaisalmer was about to be invested by
the troops of the Sultan, was conveyed to Mandor with his mother.
When only twelve years of age, he used to accompany the cow-herds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1217'>1217</span>of the old Rao’s kine, and his favourite amusement was
penning up the calves with twigs of the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>ak</em></span>, to imitate the picketing
of horses. One day, tired of this occupation, young Kehar fell
asleep upon the hole of a serpent, and the reptile issuing therefrom,
arose and spread its hood over him as he slept. A Charan
(bard, or genealogist), passing that way, reported the fact and
its import immediately to the Rana, who, proceeding to the spot,
found it was his own grandson whom fate had thus pointed out
for sovereignty.<a id='r7.4.5' /><a href='#f7.4.5' class='c013'><sup>[5]</sup></a> Gharsi, having no offspring by Bimaladevi,
proposed to her to adopt a son. All the Bhatti youth were
assembled, but none equalled Kehar, who [255] was chosen. But
the sons of Jaisar were displeased, and conspired to obtain the
<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>gaddi</em></span>. At this time, Rawal Gharsi was in the daily habit of
visiting a tank, which he was excavating, and they seized an
occasion to assassinate him; whereupon, in order to defeat their
design, Bimaladevi immediately had Kehar proclaimed. The
widowed queen of Gharsi, with the view of securing the completion
of an object which her lord had much at heart, namely, finishing
the lake Gharsisar, as well as to ensure protection to her adopted
son Kehar, determined to protract the period of self-immolation;
but when six months had elapsed, and both these objects were
attained, she finished her days on the pyre. Bimaladevi named
the children of Hamir as the adopted sons and successors of
Kehar. These sons were Jetha and Lunkaran.</div>

<p class='c001'>The coco-nut was sent by Kumbha, Rana of Chitor, to Jetha.
The Bhatti prince marched for Mewar, and when within twelve
coss of the Aravalli hills, was joined by the famous Sankhla Miraj,
chief of Salbahni. Next morning, when about to resume the
march, a partridge began to call from the right; a bad omen,
which was interpreted by the brother-in-law of the Sankhla,
deeply versed in the science of the Suguni and the language of
birds.<a id='r7.4.6' /><a href='#f7.4.6' class='c013'><sup>[6]</sup></a> Jetha drew the rein of his horse, and to avert the evil,
halted that day. Meanwhile, the partridge was caught and
found to be blind of an eye, and its ovary quite filled. The next
morning, as soon as they had taken horse, a tigress began to roar,
and the Suguni chieftain was again called upon to expound the
omen. He replied that the secrets of great houses should not be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1218'>1218</span>divulged, but he desired them to dispatch a youth, disguised as a
female Nai (barber class), to Kumbhalmer, who there would
learn the cause. The youth gained admission to ‘the ruby of
Mewar’ (Lala Mewari), who was anointing for the nuptials. He
saw things were not right, and returning made his report; upon
hearing which, the Bhatti prince married Marad, the daughter of
the Sankhla chief. The Rana was indignant at this insult, but a
sense of shame prevented his resenting it; and instead of proclaiming
the slight, he offered his daughter’s hand to the famous
Khichi prince, Achaldas of Gagraun, and it was accepted.<a id='r7.4.7' /><a href='#f7.4.7' class='c013'><sup>[7]</sup></a>
Jetha met his death, together with his brother Lunkaran, and
his brother-in-law, in an attempt to surprise Pugal: he fell with
a hundred and twenty followers. When the old Rao, Raningdeo,
discovered against whom he had thus successfully defended
himself, he clad himself in black garments [256], and in atonement
performed pilgrimage to all the shrines in India.<a id='r7.4.8' /><a href='#f7.4.8' class='c013'><sup>[8]</sup></a> On his return,
he was forgiven and condoled with by Kehar.</p>

the rest were Bija, Tana, and Tejsi.</div>

<p class='c001'>When the sons of Raningdeo became converts to Islam, in
order to avenge their father’s feud with the Rathor prince of
Nagor, they forfeited their inheritance of Pugal and Marot, and
thenceforward mixed with the Aboharia Bhattis, and their
descendants are termed Mumin Musalman Bhatti. On this
event, Kailan, the third son of the Rawal, took possession of the
forfeited lands, and besides Bikampur, regained Derawar, which
had been conquered by their ancient foes, the Dahya Rajputs.</p>

<p class='c001'>Kailan built a fort on the Bias, called, after his father, Kara, or
Karor, which again brought the Bhattis into collision with the
Johyas and Langahas, whose chief, Amir Khan Korai, attacked

whom he supported, accompanied him to Marot, on whose death,

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Chāchakdeo Rāwal, <em>c.</em> <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1448.</h4>—Chachakdeo made Marot his
headquarters, to cover his territories from the attacks of Multan,
which took umbrage at the return of the Bhattis across the Gara.
The chief of Multan united in a league all the ancient foes of the
Bhattis, the Langahas, the Johyas, the Khichis, and all the tribes
of that region. Chachak formed an army of seventeen thousand
horse and fourteen thousand foot, and crossed the Bias to meet
his foes. The encounter was desperate; but the Bhattis were
victorious, and returned with rich spoil to Marot. In the year
following another battle took place, in which seven hundred and
forty Bhattis were slain, and three thousand of the men of Multan.
By this success, the conquests of Chachak were extended, and
he left a garrison (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>thana</em></span>) under his son in Asinikot, beyond the
Bias, and returned to Pugal. He then attacked Maipal, chief
of the Dhundis,<a id='r7.4.14' /><a href='#f7.4.14' class='c013'><sup>[14]</sup></a> whom he defeated. After this victory he
repaired to Jaisalmer, to visit his brother Lachhman, reserving
the produce of the lands dependent on Asinikot<a id='r7.4.15' /><a href='#f7.4.15' class='c013'><sup>[15]</sup></a> for his expenses
at court. On his return home by Baru, he was accosted by a

the best of his flock, and demanded protection against the
raids of Birjang Rathor. This chief had wrested the celebrated
fortress of Satalmer,<a id='r7.4.17' /><a href='#f7.4.17' class='c013'><sup>[17]</sup></a> the abode of wealthy merchants, from a
Bhatti chief, and extended his forays far into the desert, and the
Janjua was one of those who had suffered by his success [258].
Not long after Rao Chachak had passed by the pastures of the
Janjua, he received a visit from him, to complain of another
inroad, which had carried off the identical goat, his offering.
Chachak assembled his kinsmen, and formed an alliance with
Shumar Khan, chief of the Seta tribe,<a id='r7.4.18' /><a href='#f7.4.18' class='c013'><sup>[18]</sup></a> who came with three
thousand horse. It was the custom of the Rathors of Satalmer
to encamp their horse at a tank some distance from the city, to
watch, while the chief citizens used daily to go abroad. Chachak
surprised and made prisoners of the whole. The bankers and
men of wealth offered large sums for their ransom; but he would
not release them from bondage, except on condition of their
settling in the territory of Jaisalmer. Three hundred and sixty-five
heads of families embraced this alternative, and hence
Jaisalmer dates the influx of her wealth. They were distributed
over the principal cities, Derawar, Pugal, Marot, etc.<a id='r7.4.19' /><a href='#f7.4.19' class='c013'><sup>[19]</sup></a> The three
sons of the Rathor were also made prisoners; the two youngest
were released, but Mera, the eldest, was detained as a hostage
for his father’s good conduct. Chachak dismissed his ally, the
Seta chief, whose granddaughter, Sonaldevi, he married. The
father of the bride, Haibat Khan,<a id='r7.4.20' /><a href='#f7.4.20' class='c013'><sup>[20]</sup></a> gave with her in <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>daeja</em></span> (dower)

war on Tharraj Khokhar, the chief of Pilibanga,<a id='r7.4.21' /><a href='#f7.4.21' class='c013'><sup>[21]</sup></a> on account of a
horse stolen from a Bhatti. The Khokhars were defeated and
plundered; but his old enemies the Langahas, taking advantage
of this occasion, made head against Chachak, and drove his
garrison from the new possession of Dhuniapur.<a id='r7.4.22' /><a href='#f7.4.22' class='c013'><sup>[22]</sup></a> Disease at
length seized on Rawal Chachak, after a long course of victorious
warfare, in which he subdued various tracts of country, even to
the heart of the Panjab. In this state he determined to die as
he had lived, with arms in his hands; but having [259] no foe
near with whom to cope, he sent an embassy to the Langaha
prince of Multan, to beg, as a last favour, the Juddhdan, or
‘gift of battle,’ that his soul might escape by the steel of his
foeman, and not fall a sacrifice to slow disease.<a id='r7.4.23' /><a href='#f7.4.23' class='c013'><sup>[23]</sup></a> The prince,
suspecting treachery, hesitated; but the Bhatti messenger
pledged his word that his master only wished an honourable
death, and that he would only bring five hundred men to the
combat. The challenge being accepted, the Rawal called his
clansmen around him, and on recounting what he had done,
seven hundred select Rajputs, who had shared in all his victories,
volunteered to take the last field, and make Sankalp (oblation)
of their lives with their leader. Previous to setting forth, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1223'>1223</span>arranged his affairs. His son Gaj Singh, by the Seta Rani, he
sent with her to her father’s house. He had five other sons,
namely, Kumbha, Barsal, Bhimdeo (by Lala Rani, of the Sodha
tribe), Rata and Randhir, whose mother was Surajdevi, of
Chauhan race. Barsal, his eldest son, he made heir to all his
dominions, except the land of Khadal (whose chief town is Derawar),
which he bestowed upon Randhir, and to both he gave the
<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>tika</em></span>, making them separate States. Barsal marched to Kahror,<a id='r7.4.24' /><a href='#f7.4.24' class='c013'><sup>[24]</sup></a>
his capital, at the head of seventeen thousand men.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Heroic Death of Rāwal Chachakdeo.</h4>—Meanwhile, Rawal
Chachak marched to Dhuniapur, “to part with life.” There he heard
that the prince of Multan was within two coss. His soul was rejoiced;
he performed his ablutions, worshipped the sword<a id='r7.4.25' /><a href='#f7.4.25' class='c013'><sup>[25]</sup></a> and the
gods, bestowed charity, and withdrew his thoughts from this world.</div>

<p class='c001'>The battle lasted four gharis (two hours), and the Jadon prince
fell with all his kin after performing prodigies of valour. Two
thousand Khans fell beneath their swords; rivers of blood flowed
in the field; but the Bhatti gained the abode of Indra, who
shared his throne with the hero. The king crossed the Bias, and
returned to Multan.</p>

<p class='c001'>While Randhir was performing at Derawar the rites of the
twelve days of <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>matam</em></span>, or ‘mourning,’ his elder brother, Kumbha,
afflicted with insanity, rushed into the assembly and swore to
avenge his father’s death. That day he departed, accompanied
by a single slave, and reached the prince’s camp. It was surrounded
by a [260] ditch eleven yards wide, over which the
Bhatti leaped his horse in the dead of night, reached the harem,
and cut off the head of Kalu Shah, with which he rejoined his
brethren at Derawar. Barsal re-established Dhuniapur, and then
went to Kahror. His old foes, the Langahas, under Haibat Khan,
again attacked him, but they were defeated with great slaughter.

history, as having given a dynasty to Sind in modern times, is a great
branch of the Yadus, and descended from Samba, son of Krishna; and
while the other branch colonized Zabulistan, maintaining the original name
of Yadus, the sons of Samba made his name the patronymic in Seistan and
the lower valley of the Indus. Samma-ka-kot, or Sammanagari, was the
capital, which yet exists, and doubtless originated the Minnagara of the
Greeks. Sambos, the opponent of Alexander, it is fair to infer, was the
chief of the Samma tribe. Samba, meaning ‘of, or belonging to, Sham or
Syama’ (an epithet of Krishna, from his dark complexion), was son of
Jambuvati, one of the eight wives of this deified Yadu. The Jarejas of
Cutch and Jams of Sind and Saurashtra are of the same stock. The Sind-Samma

the patriarch of the Sammas, in lieu of the legitimate Samba. Ferishta
gives an account of this dynasty, but was ignorant of their origin. He says,
“The Zemindars of Sinde were originally of two tribes or families, Somuna
and Soomura; and the chief of the former was distinguished by the appellation
of Jam.”—Briggs’ Ferishta, vol. iv. p. 424. The historian admits
they were Hindus until <span class='fss'>A.H.</span> 782 (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1380, S. 1436); a point of little doubt,
as we see the Bhatti prince intermarrying with this family about twenty
years subsequent even to the date assigned by Ferishta for their proselytism.

<p class='c001'><a href='#r7.4.20'>20</a>. From this and many other instances we come to the conclusion that
the Tatar or Indo-Scythic title of Khan is by no means indicative of the

As before mentioned, I believe this race called Khokhar to be the Gakkhar,
so well known to Babur, and described as his inveterate foes in all his
irruptions into India. Their manners, especially that distinctive mark,
polyandry, mentioned by Ferishta, mark the Ghakkars as Indo-Scythic.
The names of their chiefs are decidedly Hindu. They were located with the
Judis in the upper part of the Panjab, and, according to Elphinstone, they
retain their old position, contiguous to the Yusufzai Jadons. [See Rose,

</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Jaisalmer a Mughal Fief.</h4>—We have now reached that period
in the Bhatti annals when Shah Jahan was emperor of India.
Elsewhere, we have minutely related the measure which the great
Akbar adopted to attach his Rajput vassalage to the empire; a
policy pursued by his successors. Sabal Singh, the first of the
princes of Jaisalmer who held his dominions as a fief of the
empire, was not the legitimate heir to the ‘<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>gaddi</em></span> of Jaisal [262].’<a id='r7.5.1' /><a href='#f7.5.1' class='c013'><sup>[1]</sup></a>
Manohardas had obtained the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>gaddi</em></span> by the assassination of his
nephew, Rawal Nathu, the son and heir of Bhim, who was returning
from his nuptials at Bikaner, and had passed the day at
Phalodi,<a id='r7.5.2' /><a href='#f7.5.2' class='c013'><sup>[2]</sup></a> then a town of Jaisalmer, when poison was administered
to him by the hands of a female. But it was destined that the
line of the assassin should not rule, and the dignity fell to Sabal
Singh, the third in descent from Maldeo, second son of Rawal
Nunkaran.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Rāwal Sabal Singh, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1651-61.</h4>—The good qualities of
young Sabal, and the bad ones of Ramchand, son of the usurper,
afforded another ground for the preference of the former. Moreover,
Sabal was nephew to the prince of Amber, under whom he
held a distinguished post in the government of Peshawar, where
he saved the royal treasure from being captured by the Afghan
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1226'>1226</span>mountaineers. For this service, and being a favourite of the
chiefs who served with their contingents, the king gave Jaswant
Singh of Jodhpur command to place him on the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>gaddi</em></span>. The
celebrated Nahar Khan Kumpawat<a id='r7.5.3' /><a href='#f7.5.3' class='c013'><sup>[3]</sup></a> was entrusted with this
duty, for the performance of which he received the city and
domain of Pokaran, ever since severed from Jaisalmer.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Pokaran lost to Jaisalmer.</h4>—This was the first considerable
abstraction from the territories which had been progressively
increased by Rawal Jaisal and his successors, but which have
since been woefully curtailed. A short time before Babur’s
invasion, the dependencies of Jaisalmer extended on the north
to the Gara River,<a id='r7.5.4' /><a href='#f7.5.4' class='c013'><sup>[4]</sup></a> west to the Mihran or Indus; and on the
east and south they were bounded by the Rathors of Bikaner and
Marwar who had been gradually encroaching for two centuries,
and continue to do so to this day. The entire <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>thal</em></span> of Barmer and
Kotra,<a id='r7.5.5' /><a href='#f7.5.5' class='c013'><sup>[5]</sup></a> in the south, were Bhatti chieftainships, and eastward
to the site of Bikaner itself.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Rāwal Amār Singh, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1661-1702.</h4>—Amra Singh, son of
Sabal, succeeded. He led the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>tika-daur</em></span> against the Balochs, who
had invaded the western tracts, and was installed on the field of
victory. Soon after, he demanded aid from his subjects to
portion his daughter, and being opposed by his Rajput minister,
Raghunath, he put him to death. The Chana Rajputs, from the
north-east, having renewed their old raids, he in person attacked
and compelled them to give bonds, or written obligations, for
their future good conduct.</div>

<p class='c001'>Provoked by the daily encroachments of the Kandhalot
Rathors, Sundardas and Dalpat, chiefs of Bikampur, determined
to retaliate: “let us get a name in the [263] world,” said Dalpat,
“and attack the lands of the Rathors.” Accordingly, they
invaded, plundered, and fired the town of Jaju, on the Bikaner
frontier. The Kandhalots retaliated on the towns of Jaisalmer,
and an action took place, in which the Bhattis were victorious,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1227'>1227</span>slaying two hundred of the Rathors. The Rawal partook in the
triumph of his vassals. Raja Anup Singh<a id='r7.5.6' /><a href='#f7.5.6' class='c013'><sup>[6]</sup></a> of Bikaner was then
serving with the imperial armies in the Deccan. On receiving this
account, he commanded his minister to issue a summons to every
Kandhalot capable of carrying arms to invade Jaisalmer, and take
and raze Bikampur, or he would consider them traitors. The
minister issued the summons; every Rathor obeyed it, and he
added, as an auxiliary, a Pathan chief with his band from Hissar.
Rawal Amra collected his Bhattis around him, and instead of
awaiting the attack, advanced to meet it; he slew many of the
chiefs, burnt the frontier towns, and recovered Pugal, forcing the
Rathor chiefs of Barmer and Kotra to renew their engagements
of fealty and service.</p>

<p class='c001'>Amra had eight sons, and was succeeded by Jaswant, the
eldest, in S. 1758 (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1702), whose daughter was married to the
heir-apparent of Mewar.</p>

<p class='c001'>Here ends the chronicle, of which the foregoing is an abstract:
the concluding portion of the annals is from a MS. furnished by
a living chronicler, corrected by other information. It is but a
sad record of anarchy and crime.</p>

<p class='c001'>Soon after the death of Rawal Amra, Pugal, Barmer, Phalodi,
and various other towns and territories in Jaisalmer, were wrested

Budh Singh died of the smallpox; Tej Singh, uncle to the
Rawal, usurped the government, and the princes fled to Delhi to
save their lives. At this period, their grand-uncle, Hari Singh
(brother of Rawal Jaswant), was serving the king, and he returned
in order to displace the usurper. It is customary for the [264]
prince of Jaisalmer to go annually in state to the lake Gharsisar,
to perform the ceremony of <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>Las</em></span>, or clearing away the accumulation
of mud and sand.<a id='r7.5.9' /><a href='#f7.5.9' class='c013'><sup>[9]</sup></a> The Raja first takes out a handful, when
rich and poor follow his example. Hari Singh chose the time

attempt did not altogether succeed; but Tej Singh was so severely
wounded that he died, and was succeeded by his son,</div>

<p class='c001'>Sawai Singh, an infant of three years of age. Akhai Singh
collected the Bhattis from all quarters, stormed the castle, put
the infant to death, and regained his rights.</p>

<p class='c001'>Akhai Singh ruled forty years. During this reign, Bahawal
Khan, son of Daud Khan, took Derawar, and all the tract of
Khadal, the first Bhatti conquest, and added it to his new State
of Bahawalpur, or Daudputra.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Rāwal Mūlrāj, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1762-1820. Conspiracy against Mūlrāj.</h4>—Mulraj
succeeded in S. 1818 (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1762). He had three sons, Rae
Singh, Jeth Singh, and Man Singh. The unhappy choice of a
minister by Mulraj completed the demoralization of the Bhatti
principality. This minister was named Sarup Singh, a Bania of
the Jain faith and Mehta family, destined to be the exterminators
of the laws and fortunes of the ‘sons of Jaisal.’ The cause of
hatred and revenge of this son of commerce to the Bhatti aristocracy
arose out of a disgraceful dispute regarding a Bakhtan, a
fair frail one, a favourite of the Mehta, but who preferred the
Rajput, Sardar Singh, of the tribe of Aef.<a id='r7.5.10' /><a href='#f7.5.10' class='c013'><sup>[10]</sup></a> The Bhatti chief
carried his complaint of the minister to the heir-apparent, Rae
Singh, who had also cause of grievance in the reduction of his
income. It was suggested to the prince to put this presumptuous
minister to death; this was effected by the prince’s own hand,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1229'>1229</span>in his father’s presence; and as the Mehta, in falling, clung to
Mulraj for protection, it was proposed to take off Mulraj at the
same time. The proposition, however, was rejected with horror
by the prince, whose vengeance was satisfied. The Rawal was
allowed to escape to the female apartments; but the chieftains,
well knowing they could not expect pardon from the Rawal,
insisted on investing Rae Singh, and if he refused, on placing
his brother on the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>gaddi</em></span>. The <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>an</em></span> of Rae Singh was proclaimed;
but no entreaty or threat would induce him to listen to the
proposal of occupying the throne; in lieu of which he used a
pallet (khat). Three months and five days had passed since the
deposal and bondage of Mulraj, when a female resolved to emancipate
him: this female was the wife of the chief conspirator, and
confidential adviser of the regent prince. This noble dame, a
Rathor Rajputni, of the Malecha clan, was the wife of Anup
Singh of Jinjiniali, the premier noble of Jaisalmer, and who,
wearied with the tyranny of the minister and the weakness of his
[265] prince, had proposed the death of the one and the deposal
of the other. We are not made acquainted with any reason,
save that of Swamidharma, or ‘fealty,’ which prompted the
Rathorni to rescue her prince even at the risk of her husband’s
life; but her appeal to her son Zorawar, to perform his duty, is
preserved, and we give it verbatim: “Should your father oppose
you, sacrifice him to your duty, and I will mount the pyre with
his corpse.” The son yielded obedience to the injunction of his
magnanimous parent, who had sufficient influence to gain over
Arjun, the brother of her husband, as well as Megh Singh, chief of
Baru. The three chieftains forced an entrance into the prison
where their prince was confined, who refused to be released from
his manacles, until he was told that the Mahechi had promoted
the plot for his liberty. The sound of the grand nakkara, proclaiming
Mulraj’s repossession of the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>gaddi</em></span>, awoke his son from
sleep; and on the herald depositing at the side of his pallet
the sable <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>saropa</em></span>,<a id='r7.5.11' /><a href='#f7.5.11' class='c013'><sup>[11]</sup></a> and all the insignia of exile—the black steed
and black vestments—the prince, obeying the command of the
emancipated Rawal, clad himself therein, and accompanied by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1230'>1230</span>his party, bade adieu to Jaisalmer and took the road to Kotra.
When he arrived at this town, on the southern frontier of the
State, the chiefs proposed to “run the country”; but he replied,
“the country was his mother, and every Rajput his foe who
injured it.” He repaired to Jodhpur, but the chieftains abided
about Sheo Kotra and Barmer, and during the twelve years they
remained outlaws, plundered even to the gates of Jaisalmer. In
the first three years they devastated the country, their castles
were dismantled, the wells therein filled up, and their estates
sequestrated. At the end of the twelve, having made the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>talak</em></span>,
or oath against further plunder, their estates were restored, and
they were readmitted into their country.</div>

<p class='c001'>The banished prince remained two years and a half with Raja
Bijai Singh, who treated him like a son. But he carried his
arrogant demeanour with him to Jodhpur; for one day, as he
was going out to hunt, a Bania, to whom he was indebted, seized
his horse by the bridle, and invoking the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>an</em></span> of Bijai Singh, demanded
payment of his debt. The prince, in turn, required him,
with the invocation “by Mulraj!” to unloose his hold. But
the man of wealth, disregarding the appeal, insolently replied,
“What is Mulraj to me?” It was the last word he spoke; the
sword of Rae Singh was unsheathed, and the Bania’s head rolled
on the ground: then, turning his horse’s [266] head to Jaisalmer,
he exclaimed, “Better be a slave at once than live on the bounty
of another.” His unexpected arrival outside his native city
brought out the entire population to see him. His father, the
Rawal, sent to know what had occasioned his presence, and he
replied that it was merely preparatory to pilgrimage. He was
refused admittance; his followers were disarmed, and he was
sent to reside at the fortress of Dewa, together with his sons
Abhai Singh and Dhonkal Singh, and their families.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Sālim Singh, Prime Minister.</h4>—Salim Singh, who succeeded his
father as prime minister of Jaisalmer, was but eleven years of
age at the time of his murder. His young mind appears, even
at that early age, to have been a hotbed for revenge; and the
seeds which were sown soon quickened into a luxuriance rarely
equalled even in those regions, where human life is held in little
estimation. Without any of that daring valour which distinguishes
the Rajput, he overcame, throughout a long course of
years, all who opposed him, uniting the subtlety of the serpent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1231'>1231</span>to the ferocity of the tiger. In person he was effeminate, in
speech bland; pliant and courteous in demeanour; promising,
without hesitation, and with all the semblance of sincerity, what
he never had the most remote intention to fulfil. Salim, or, as
he was generally designated by his tribe, the Mehta, was a signal
instance of a fact of which these annals exhibit too many examples,
namely, the inadequacy of religious professions, though of a
severe character, as a restraint on moral conduct; for though
the tenets of his faith (the Jain) imperatively prescribe the
necessity of “hurting no sentient being,” and of sitting in the
dark rather than, by luring a moth into the flame of a lamp, incur
the penalty attached to the sin of insect-murder, this man has
sent more of ‘the sons of Jassa’ to Yamaloka<a id='r7.5.12' /><a href='#f7.5.12' class='c013'><sup>[12]</sup></a> than the sword
of their external foes during his long administration. He had
scarcely attained man’s estate when the outlawed chiefs were
restored to their estates by a singular intervention. Raja Bhim
Singh had acceded to the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>gaddi</em></span> of Marwar, and the Mehta was
chosen by the prince of Jaisalmer, as his representative, to convey
his congratulations, and the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>tika</em></span> of acknowledgment on his
succession, to Raja Bijai Singh. On his return from this mission,
he was waylaid and captured by the outlawed chieftains, who
instantly passed sentence of death upon the author of their
miseries. The sword was uplifted, when, “placing his turban at
the feet of Zorawar Singh,” he implored his protection—and he
found it! Such is the Rajput—an anomaly amongst his species;
his character a compound of the opposite and antagonistical
qualities which impel mankind to virtue and to crime. Let me
recall to the mind of the reader that the protector of this vampire
[267] was the virtuous son of the virtuous Rajputni who, with an
elevation of mind equal to whatever is recorded of Greek or
Roman heroines, devoted herself, and a husband whom she loved,
to the one predominant sentiment of the Rajput, Swamidharma,
or ‘fealty to the sovereign.’ Yet had the wily Mehta effected
the disgrace of this brave chief, to whom the Rawal owed his
release from bondage and restoration to his throne, and forced
him to join the outlaws amidst the sand-hills of Barmer. Nothing
can paint more strongly the influence of this first of the Bhatti
chiefs over his brethren than the act of preserving the life of their
mortal foe, thus cast into their hands; for not only did they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1232'>1232</span>dissuade him from the act, but prophesied his repentance of such
mistaken clemency. Only one condition was stipulated, their
restoration to their homes. They were recalled, but not admitted
to court: a distinction reserved for Zorawar alone.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Death of Rāe Singh.</h4>—When Rae Singh was incarcerated in
Dewa, his eldest son, Abhai Singh, Rajkumar, ‘heir-apparent,’
with the second son, Dhonkal, were left at Barmer, with the
outlawed chiefs. The Rawal, having in vain demanded his
grandchildren, prepared an army and invested Barmer. It was
defended during six months, when a capitulation was acceded to,
and the children were given up to Mulraj on the bare pledge of
Zorawar Singh, who guaranteed their safety; and they were
sent to the castle of Dewa, where their father was confined.
Soon after, the castle was fired, and Rae Singh and his wife were
consumed in the flames. On escaping this danger, which was
made to appear accidental, the young princes were confined in
the fortress of Ramgarh, in the most remote corner of the desert,
bordering the valley of Sind, for their security and that of the
Rawal (according to the Mehta’s account), and to prevent faction
from having a nucleus around which to form. But Zorawar, who
entertained doubts of the minister’s motives, reminded the Rawal
that the proper place for the heir-apparent was the court, and
that his honour stood pledged for his safety. This was sufficient
for the Mehta, whose mind was instantly intent upon the means
to rid himself of so conscientious an adviser. Zorawar had a
brother named Ketsi, whose wife, according to the courtesy of
Rajwara, had adopted the minister as her brother. Salim sounded
his adopted sister as to her wish to see her husband become lord
of Jinjiniali. The tempter succeeded: he furnished her with
poisoned comfits, which she administered to the gallant Zorawar;
and her lord was inducted into the estates of Jinjiniali. Having
thus disposed of the soul of the Bhatti nobility, he took off in
detail the chiefs of Baru, Dangri, and many others, chiefly by the
same means, though some by [268] the dagger. Ketsi, who,
whether innocent or a guilty participant in his brother’s death,
had benefited thereby, was marked in the long list of proscription
of this fiend, who determined to exterminate every Rajput of note.
Ketsi knew too much, and those connected with him shared in
this dangerous knowledge: wife, brother, son, were therefore
destined to fall by the same blow. The immediate cause of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1233'>1233</span>enmity was as follows. The minister, who desired to set aside
the claims of the children of Rae Singh to the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>gaddi</em></span>, and to
nominate the youngest son of Mulraj as heir-apparent, was
opposed by Ketsi, as it could only be effected by the destruction
of the former; and he replied, that “no co-operation of his
should sanction the spilling of the blood of any of his master’s
family.” Salim treasured up the remembrance of this opposition
to his will, though without any immediate sign of displeasure.
Soon after, Ketsi and his brother Sarup were returning from a
nuptial ceremony at Kanera, in the district of Balotra. On
reaching Bhikarai, on the Jaisalmer frontier, where the ministers
of the Mehta’s vengeance were posted, the gallant Zorawar and
his brother were conducted into the castle, out of which their
bodies were brought only to be burnt. Hearing of some intended
evil to her lord, Ketsi’s wife, with her infant son, Megha, sought
protection in the minister’s own abode, where she had a double
claim, as his adopted sister, to sanctuary and protection. For
five days, the farce was kept up of sending food for herself and
child; but the slave who conveyed it remarking, in coarse,
unfeeling language, that both her husband and her brother were
with their fathers, she gave a loose to grief and determined on
revenge. This being reported to the Mehta, he sent a dagger
for her repose.</div>

<p class='c001'>The princes, Abhai Singh and Dhonkal Singh, confined in the
fortress of Ramgarh, soon after the murder of Ketsi were carried
off, together with their wives and infants, by poison. The
murderer then proclaimed Gaj Singh, the youngest but one of all
the posterity of Mulraj, as heir-apparent. His brothers sought
security in flight from this fiend-like spirit of the minister, and
are now refugees in the Bikaner territory. The following slip
from the genealogical tree will show the branches so unmercifully
lopped off by this monster:</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Long Reigns of Rājput Princes.</h4>—It is a singular fact, that the
longest reigns we know of in Rajwara occurred during ministerial
usurpations. The late Maharao of Kotah occupied the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>gaddi</em></span>
upwards of half a century, and the Rawal Mulraj swayed the
nominal sceptre of this <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>oasis</em></span> of the desert upwards of fifty-eight
years. His father ruled forty years, and I doubt whether, in all
history, we can find another instance of father and son reigning
for a century.<a id='r7.5.14' /><a href='#f7.5.14' class='c013'><sup>[14]</sup></a> This century was prolific in change to the dynasty,
whose whole history is full of strange vicissitudes. If we go back
to Jaswant Singh, the grandfather of Mulraj, we find the Bhatti
principality touching the Gara on the north, which divided it
from Multan; on the west it was bounded by the Panjnad, and
thus included a narrow slip of the fertile valley of Sind; and we
have seen it stretch, at no remote period, even to the ancient
capital Mansura, better known to the Hindu as Rori-Bakhar,<a id='r7.5.15' /><a href='#f7.5.15' class='c013'><sup>[15]</sup></a>
the islandic capital of the Sogdoi (Sodha) of Alexander. To the
south, it rested on Dhat, including the castles of Sheo, Kotra, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1235'>1235</span>Barmer, seized on by Marwar; and in the east embraced the
districts of Phalodi, Pokaran, and other parts, also in the possession
of Marwar or Bikaner. The whole of the State of Bahawalpur
is formed out of the Bhatti dominion, and the Rathors have
obtained therefrom not a small portion of their western frontier.
This abstraction of territory will account for the heartburnings
and border-feuds which continually break out between the
Bhattis and Rathors, and ‘the children of David (Daudputras).’</div>

<p class='c001'>Could the same prophetic steel which carved upon the pillar
of Brahmsar the destinies of the grandson of the deified Hari,
eleven hundred years before Christ, have subjoined to that of
Jaisal the fate which awaited his descendant Mulraj, he would
doubtless have regarded the prophecy as conveying a falsehood
too gross for belief. That the offspring of the deified prince of
Dwarka, who founded Ghazni, and fought the [270] united kings
of Syria and Bactria, should, at length, be driven back on India,
and compelled to seek shelter under the sign of the cross, reared
amidst their sand-hills by a handful of strangers, whose ancestors,
when they were even in the maturity of their fame, were wandering
in their native woods, with painted bodies, and offering human
sacrifices to the sun-god—more resembling Balsiva than Balkrishna—these
would have seemed prodigies too wild for faith.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>CHAPTER 6</h3>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Treaty with the British.</h4>—It was in the Samvat (era) of Vikrama,
1818,<a id='r7.6.1' /><a href='#f7.6.1' class='c013'><sup>[1]</sup></a> that Rawal Mulraj was inaugurated on the throne of Jaisal;
and it was in the year of our Lord 1818, that a treaty of “perpetual
friendship, alliance, and unity of interests” was concluded
between the Honourable East-India Company and Maha Rawal
Mulraj, the Raja of Jaisalmer, his heirs and successors, the
latter agreeing “to act in subordinate co-operation with the
British Government, and with submission to its supremacy.”<a id='r7.6.2' /><a href='#f7.6.2' class='c013'><sup>[2]</sup></a>
This was almost the last act of Rawal Mulraj, who had always
been a mere puppet in the hands of Mehta Salim Singh or his
father. He died <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1820, when his grandson, Gaj Singh, was
proclaimed.</div>

<div class='section-start'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1236'>1236</span><h4 class='disp-inline'>Maharāwal Gaj Singh, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1820-46.</h4>—Rawal Gaj Singh was
fitted, from his years, his past seclusion, and the examples which
had occurred before his eyes, to be the submissive pageant Salim
Singh required. Isolated, in every sense, from intercourse with
the rest of mankind, by the [271] policy of the minister, he had no
community of sympathy with them, and no claim upon their aid.
Surrounded by the creatures of Salim Singh, who, even to their
daily dole, ascribe everything to this man’s favour, each word,
each gesture, is watched and reported. The prince himself, his
wives and family, are alike dependents on the minister’s bounty,
often capriciously exercised. If he requires a horse, he must
solicit it; or if desirous of bestowing some recompense, he requests
to be furnished with the means, and deems himself fortunate if
he obtain a moiety of his suit.</div>

<p class='c001'>It will be observed from the date of this treaty (Dec. 1818),
that Jaisalmer was the last of the States of India received under
the protection of the British Government. Its distance made it
an object of little solicitude to us; and the minister, it is said,
had many long and serious consultations with his oracles before
he united his destiny with ours. He doubted the security of his
power if the Rawal should become subordinate to the British
Government; and he was only influenced by the greater risk of
being the sole State in Rajwara without the pale of its protection,
which would have left him to the mercy of those enemies whom
his merciless policy had created around him. The third and
most important article of the treaty<a id='r7.6.3' /><a href='#f7.6.3' class='c013'><sup>[3]</sup></a> tranquillized his apprehensions
as to external foes; with these apprehensions all fear as to
the consequences arising from ministerial tyranny towards the
princely exiles was banished, and we shall presently find that this
alliance, instead of checking his rapacity and oppression, incited
them. But it is necessary, in the first place, to bestow a few
remarks on the policy of the alliance as regards the British
Government.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Treaty of Alliance.</h4>—Its inequality requires no demonstration;
the objects to be attained by it to the respective parties
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1237'>1237</span>having no approximation to parity. The advantages to Jaisalmer
were immediate; and to use the phraseology of the treaty, were
not only of “great magnitude,” but were vitally important.
From the instant the treaties were exchanged, her existence as a
permanent State, which was not worth half a century’s purchase,
was secured. Her power had been gradually declining, and
reign after reign was narrowing her possessions to the vicinity of
the capital. One State, Bahawalpur, had been formed from her
northern territory; while those of Sind, Bikaner, and Jodhpur,
had been greatly aggrandized at her expense; and all were
inclined, as occasion arose, to encroach upon her feebleness. The
faithless character of the minister, Salim Singh [272], afforded
abundant pretexts for quarrel, and the anarchy of her neighbours
proved her only safeguard during the later years of her
independent existence. Now, the British Government having
pledged itself to exert its power for the protection of the principality,
in the event of any “serious invasion,” her fears either of
Sindis, Daudputras, or of Rathors, are at rest. The full extent
of this pledge may not have been contemplated when it was
given; like all former alliances, it is the base of another step in
advance. Instead of restricting the vast circle of our political
connexions, it at once carried us out of India, placing us in actual
contact and possible collision with the rulers of Sind and the
people beyond the Indus. Marwar and Bikaner being already
admitted to our alliance, the power of settling their feuds with
the Bhattis is comparatively simple; but with Daudputra we
have no political connexions, and with Sind, only those of “perpetual
friendship and mutual intercourse”; but no stipulation
ensuring respect to our remonstrances in case of the aggression
of their subjects on our Bhatti ally. Are we then to push our
troops through the desert to repel such acts, or must we furnish
pecuniary subsidies (the cheapest mode), that she may entertain
mercenaries for that object? We must view it, in this light, as
an event, not only not improbable, but of very likely occurrence.
Our alliance with Cutch involved us in this perplexity in 1819.
Our armies were formed and moved to the frontier, and a declaration
of war was avoided only by accepting a tardy <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>amende</em></span> in no
way commensurate with the insult of invading, massacring, and
pillaging our allies.<a id='r7.6.4' /><a href='#f7.6.4' class='c013'><sup>[4]</sup></a> In this instance, our means of chastisement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1238'>1238</span>were facilitated by our maritime power of grappling with the
enemy; but if the insult proceeds from the government of Upper
Sind (only nominally dependent on Haidarabad), or from Bahawalpur,
how are we to cope with these enemies of our ally? Such
wars might lead us into a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>terra incognita</em></span> beyond the Indus, or
both the spirit and letter of the treaty will be null.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Strategical Importance of Jaisalmer.</h4>—What, therefore,
are the advantages we can hold out to ourselves for the volunteer
of our amity and protection to this oasis of the desert? To have
disregarded the appeal of Jaisalmer for protection, to have made
her the sole exception in all Rajputana from our amicable relations,
would have been to consign her to her numerous enemies,
and to let loose the spirit of rapine and revenge, which it was the
main object [273] of all these treaties to suppress; the Bhattis
would have become a nation of robbers, the Bedouins of the
Indian desert. Jaisalmer was the first link in a chain of free
States, which formerly united the commerce of the Ganges with
that of the Indus, but which interminable feuds had completely
severed; the possibility of reunion depending upon a long continuance
of tranquillity and confidence. This object alone
would have warranted our alliance with Jaisalmer. But if we
look to futurity, to the possible invasion of India, which can be
best effected through the maritime provinces of Persia, the valley
of the Indus will be the base of the invader’s operations. The
possession of Jaisalmer would then be of vital importance, by
giving us the command of Upper Sind, and enabling us to act
against the enemy simultaneously with our armies east of the
Delta, the most practicable point of advance into India. We
may look upon invasion by the ancient routes pursued by Alexander,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1239'>1239</span>Mahmud, and Timur, as utterly visionary, by an army
encumbered with all the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>matériel</em></span> necessary to success, and thus
the valley of Sind presents the only practicable route. But it
would be a grand error, both in a political and military point of
view, to possess ourselves of this valley, even if an opportunity
were again to occur. It is true, the resources of that fertile region,
so analogous to Egypt, would soon, under our management,
maintain an army sufficient to defend it; and this would bring
us at once into contact with the power (Persia) which clings to
us for support, and will be adverse to us only when rendered
subservient to Russia. It were well to view the possible degradation
and loss of power to Russia, in Europe, as likely to afford a
fresh stimulant to her ancient schemes of oriental aggrandizement.
By some these schemes are looked upon as Quixotic, and I confess
myself to be of the number. The better Russia is acquainted
with the regions she would have to pass, the less desire will she
evince for an undertaking, which, even if successful in the outset,
would be useless; for if she conquered, she could not maintain
India.<a id='r7.6.5' /><a href='#f7.6.5' class='c013'><sup>[5]</sup></a> But, to me, it still appears imperative that this power
should formally renounce such designs; the state of perpetual
preparation rendered necessary by her menacing position, being
so injurious to our finances, is worse than the actual attempt,
which would only entail upon her inevitable loss. We lost,
through our unwise economy, a noble opportunity of maintaining
an ascendancy at the court of Kabul, which would have been
easily prevailed upon, for our pecuniary aid, to make over to us
the sovereignty of Sind (were this desirable), which is still considered
a grand division of Kabul.</div>

<p class='c001'>But setting the political question aside, and considering our
possession of the [274] valley of Sind only in a military point of
view, our occupation of it would be prejudicial to us. We should
have a long line to defend, and rivers are no barriers in modern
warfare. Whilst an impassable desert is between us, and we have
the power, by means of our allies, of assailing an enemy at several
points, though we are liable to attack but from one, an invader
could not maintain himself a single season. On this ground, the
maintenance of friendship with this remote nook of Rajput
civilization is defensible, and we have the additional incitement
of rescuing the most industrious and wealthy commercial communities
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1240'>1240</span>in India from the fangs of a harpy; to whom, and the
enormities of his government, we return.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Effect of the Treaty on the Policy of Sālim Singh.</h4>—No language
can adequately represent the abuse of power with which the
treaty has armed the rapacious minister of Jaisalmer, and it is
one of the many instances of the inefficacy of our system of
alliances to secure prosperity, or even tranquillity to these long-afflicted
regions; which, although rescued from external assailants,
are still the prey of discord and passion within. It will not be
difficult, at the proper time and place, to make this appear.<a id='r7.6.6' /><a href='#f7.6.6' class='c013'><sup>[6]</sup></a>
The Mehta felt the advantages which the treaty gave him, in
respect to neighbouring States; but he also felt that he had
steeped himself too deeply in the blood of his master’s family,
and in that of his noblest chieftains, to hope that any repentance,
real or affected, could restore to him the confidence of those he
had so outraged. With commercial men, with the industrious
husbandman or pastoral communities, he had so long forfeited
all claim to credit, that his oath was not valued at a single grain
of the sand of their own desert dominion.</div>

<p class='c001'>The bardic annalist of Rajputana, when compelled to record
the acts of a tyrant, first announces his moral death; then comes
the metempsychosis—the animating his frame with the spirit
of a demon. In this manner is delineated the famed Bisaldeo,
the Chauhan king of Ajmer. Whether the Bhatti minister will
obtain such a posthumous apology for his misdeeds, a future
historian will learn; but assuredly he is never mentioned, either
in poetry or prose, but as a vampire, draining the life-blood of a
whole people. For a short time after the treaty was formed,
he appeared to fall in with the march of universal reformation;
but whether it was that his crimes had outlawed him from the
sympathies of all around, or that he could feel no enjoyment but
in his habitual crimes, he soon gave indulgence to his rapacious
spirit. The cause of his temporary forbearance was attributed to
his anxiety to have [275] an article added to the treaty, guaranteeing
the office of prime minister in his family, perhaps with a view
to legalize his plunder; but seeing no hope of fixing an hereditary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1241'>1241</span>race of vampires on the land, his outrages became past all endurance,
and compelled the British agent, at length, to report to his
government (on December 17, 1821), that he considered the
alliance disgraceful to our reputation, by countenancing the idea
that such acts can be tolerated under its protection. Representations
to the minister were a nullity; he protested against their
fidelity; asserted in specious language his love of justice and
mercy; and recommenced his system of confiscations, contributions,
and punishments, with redoubled severity.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Misgovernment of Sālim Singh.</h4>—All Rajwara felt an interest
in these proceedings, as the bankers of Jaisalmer, supported by
the capital of that singular class, the Paliwals, are spread all over
India. But this rich community, amounting to five thousand
families, are nearly all in voluntary exile, and the bankers fear to
return to their native land with the fruits of their industry, which
they would renounce for ever, but that he retains their families
as hostages. Agriculture is almost unknown, and commerce,
internal or external, has ceased through want of security. The
sole revenue arises from confiscation. It is asserted that the
minister has amassed no less than <em>two crores</em>, which wealth is
distributed in the various cities of Hindustan, and has been
obtained by pillage and the destruction of the most opulent
families of his country during the last twenty years. He has also,
it is said, possessed himself of all the crown-jewels and property
of value, which he has sent out of the country. Applications were
continually being made to the British agent for passports (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>parwanas</em></span>),
by commercial men, to withdraw their families from the
country. But all have some ties which would be hazarded by
their withdrawing, even if such a step were otherwise free from
danger; for while the minister afforded passports, in obedience
to the wish of the agent, he might cut them off in the desert.
This makes many bear the ills they have.<a id='r7.6.7' /><a href='#f7.6.7' class='c013'><sup>[7]</sup></a></div>

<div class='section-start'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1242'>1242</span><h4 class='disp-inline'>A Border Feud.</h4>—We shall terminate our historical sketch of
Jaisalmer with the details of a border feud, which called into
operation the main condition of the British alliance—the right of
universal arbitration in the international quarrels of Rajputana.
The predatory habits of the Maldots of Baru originated a rupture,
which threatened to involve the two States in war, and produced
an invasion of the Rathors, sufficiently serious to warrant British
interference. It will hardly be credited that this aggression,
which drew down upon the Maldots the vengeance of Bikaner,
was covertly stimulated by the minister, for the express purpose
of their extirpation, for reasons which will [276] appear presently;
yet he was the first to complain of the retaliation. To understand
this matter, a slight sketch of the Maldot tribe is requisite.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>The Maldot Tribe.</h4>—The Maldots, the Kailans, the Birsangs,
the Pohars, and Tejmalots, are all Bhatti tribes; but, from their
lawless habits, these names have become, like those of Bedouin,
Kazzak, or Pindari, synonymous with ‘robber.’ The first are
descended from Rao Maldeo, and hold the fief (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>patta</em></span>) of Baru,
consisting of eighteen villages, adjoining the tract called Kharipatta,
wrested from the Bhattis by the Rathors of Bikaner, who,
to confess the truth, morally deserve the perpetual hostility of
this Bhatti lord-marcher, inasmuch as they were the intruders,
and have deprived them (the Bhattis) of much territory. But
the Rathors, possessing the right of the strongest, about twenty-five
years ago exercised it in the most savage manner; for, having
invaded Baru, they put almost the entire community to the
sword, without respect to age or sex, levelled the towns, filled up
the wells, and carried off the herds and whatever was of value.
The survivors took shelter in the recesses of the desert, and
propagated a progeny, which, about the period of connexion with
the British, reoccupied their deserted lands. The minister, it is
asserted, beheld the revival of this infant colony with no more
favourable eye than did their enemies of Bikaner, whom, it is
alleged, he invited once more to their destruction. The lawless
habits of this tribe would have been assigned by the minister as
his motive for desiring their extermination; but if we look back
(p. 1232), we shall discover the real cause in his having incurred the
lasting enmity of this clan for the foul assassination of their chief,
who had been a party to the views of the heir-apparent, Rae Singh,
to get rid of this incubus on their freedom. The opportunity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1243'>1243</span>afforded to take vengeance on the Maldots arose out of a service
indirectly done to the British Government. On the revolt of the
Peshwa, he sent his agents to Jaisalmer to purchase camels. One
herd, to the number of four hundred, had left the Bhatti frontiers,
and whilst passing through the Bikaner territory, were set upon
by the Maldots, who captured the whole and conveyed them to
Baru. It is scarcely to be supposed that such an aggression on
the independence of Bikaner would have prompted her extensive
armament, or the rapidity with which her troops passed the
Bhatti frontier to avenge the insult, without some private signal
from the minister, who was loud in his call for British interference;
though not until Nokh<a id='r7.6.8' /><a href='#f7.6.8' class='c013'><sup>[8]</sup></a> and Baru, their principal towns, were
levelled, the chief killed, the wells filled up, and the victorious
army following up its success by a rapid march on Bikampur, in
which the fiscal lands began to suffer. The minister then discovered
he had overshot the mark, and claimed [277] our interference,<a id='r7.6.9' /><a href='#f7.6.9' class='c013'><sup>[9]</sup></a>
which was rapid and effectual; and the Bikaner commander
the more willingly complied with the request to retire
within his own frontier, having effected more than his object.</div>

<p class='c001'>The tortuous policy, the never-ending and scarcely-to-be-comprehended
border feuds of these regions, must, for a long
while, generate such appeals. Since these associated bands
attach no dishonour to their predatory profession, it will be some
time before they acquire proper notions; but when they discover
there is no retreat in which punishment may not reach them,
they will learn the benefits of cultivating the arts of peace, of
whose very name no trace exists in their history.</p>

<p class='c001'>We have lost sight of the Rawal, the title of the prince of
Jaisalmer, in the prominent acts of his minister. Gaj Singh, who
occupies the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>gaddi</em></span> of Jaisal, to the prejudice of his elder brothers,
who are still in exile in Bikaner, appears very well suited to the
minister’s purpose, and to have little desire beyond his horses,
and vegetating in quiet. The physiognomists of Jaisalmer,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1244'>1244</span>however, prognosticate the development of moral worth in due
season; a consummation devoutly to be wished, and the first
symptom of which must be the riddance of his minister by whatever
process. The artful Salim deemed that it would redound to
his credit, and bolster up his interest, to seek a matrimonial
alliance with the Rana’s family of Mewar. The overture was
accepted, and the coco-symbol transmitted to the Rawal, who
put himself at the head of the Bhatti chivalry to wed and escort
his bride through the desert. The Rathor princes of Bikaner
and Kishangarh, who were at the same time suitors for the hands
of another daughter and a granddaughter of the Rana, simultaneously
arrived at Udaipur with their respective cortèges; and
this triple alliance threw a degree of splendour over the capital of
the Sesodias, to which it had long been a stranger. Gaj Singh
lives very happily with his wife, who has given him an heir to his
desert domain. The influence of high rank is seen in the respect
paid to the Ranawatji (the title by which she is designated), even
by the minister, and she exerts this influence most humanely for
the amelioration of her subjects<a id='r7.6.10' /><a href='#f7.6.10' class='c013'><sup>[10]</sup></a> [278].</p>

succession of his eldest son as prime minister, but the British Government
declined to interfere in the appointment or punishment of a minister, on

<p class='c012'><b>Geography of Jaisalmer.</b>—The country still dependent on the
Rawal extends between 70° 30´ and 72° 30´ E. long., and between
the parallels of 26° 20´ and 27° 50´ N. lat., though a small strip
protrudes, in the N.-E. angle, as high as 28° 30´. This irregular
surface may be roughly estimated to contain fifteen thousand

fifty; some estimate it at three hundred, and others depress it
to two hundred; the mean cannot be wide of the truth. To
enable the reader to arrive at a conclusion as to the population
of this region, we subjoin a calculation, from data furnished by
the best-informed natives, which was made in the year 1815:
but we must add, that from the tyranny of the minister, the
population of the capital (which is nearly half of the country), has
been greatly diminished.</p>

<p class='c001'>According to this census, we have a population not superior
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1246'>1246</span>to one of the secondary cities of Great Britain, scattered over
fifteen thousand square miles; nearly one-half, too, belonging
to the capital, which being omitted, the result would give from
two to three souls only for each square mile.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Face of the Country.</h4>—The greater part of Jaisalmer is <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>thal</em></span>, or
<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>rui</em></span>, both terms meaning ‘a desert waste.’ From Lohwar, on the
Jodhpur frontier, to Khara, the remote angle touching Sind, the
country may be described as a continuous tract of arid sand,
frequently rising into lofty <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>tibas</em></span> (sand-hills), in some parts covered
with low jungle. This line, which nearly bisects Jaisalmer, is
also the line of demarcation of positive sterility and comparative
cultivation. To the north is one uniform and naked waste; to
the south are ridges of rock termed <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>magra</em></span>, <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>rui</em></span>, and light soil [280].</div>

<p class='c001'>The ridge of hills is a most important feature in the geology
of this desert region.<a id='r7.7.2' /><a href='#f7.7.2' class='c013'><sup>[2]</sup></a> It is to be traced from Cutch Bhuj, strongly
or faintly marked, according to the nature of the country. Sometimes
it assumes, as at Chhotan, the character of a mountain; then
dwindles into an insignificant ridge scarcely discernible, and often
serves as a bulwark for the drifting sands, which cover and render
it difficult to trace it at all. As it reaches the Jaisalmer country
it is more developed; and at the capital, erected on a peak about
two hundred and fifty feet high, its presence is more distinct, and
its character defined. The capital of the Bhattis appears as the
nucleus of a series of ridges, which diverge from it in all directions
for the space of fifteen miles. One branch terminates at Ramgarh,
thirty-five miles north-west of Jaisalmer; another branch extends
easterly to Pokaran (in Jodhpur), and thence, in a north-east
direction, to Phalodi; from whence, at intervals, it is traceable
to Gariala, nearly fifty miles due north. It is a yellow-coloured
sandstone, in which ochre is abundantly found, with which the
people daub their houses.</p>

<p class='c001'>These barren ridges, and the lofty undulating <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>tibas</em></span> of sand, are
the only objects which diversify the almost uniform sterility of
these regions. No trees interpose their verdant foliage to relieve
the eye, or shelter the exhausted frame of the traveller. It is
nearly a boundless waste, varied only by a few stunted shrubs of
the acacia or mimosa family, some succulent plants, or prickly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1247'>1247</span>grasses, as the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>bharut</em></span><a id='r7.7.3' /><a href='#f7.7.3' class='c013'><sup>[3]</sup></a> or burr, which clings to his garment and
increases his miseries. Yet compared with the more northern
portion, where “a sea of sand without a sign of vegetation”<a id='r7.7.4' /><a href='#f7.7.4' class='c013'><sup>[4]</sup></a>
forms the prospect, the vicinity of the capital is a paradise.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is not a running stream throughout Jaisalmer; but
there are many temporary lakes or salt-marshes, termed <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>sar</em></span>,
formed by the collection of waters from the sand-hills, which are
easily dammed in to prevent escape. They are ephemeral,
seldom lasting but a few months; though after a very severe
monsoon they have been known to remain throughout the year.
One of these, called the Kanod Sar, extends from Kanod<a id='r7.7.5' /><a href='#f7.7.5' class='c013'><sup>[5]</sup></a> to
Mohangarh, covering a space of eighteen miles, and in which some
water remains throughout the year. When it overflows, a small
stream issues from the Sar, and pursues an easterly direction for
thirty miles before it is absorbed; its existence [281] depends
on the parent lake. The salt which it produces is the property
of the crown, and adds something to the revenue.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Soil, Husbandry, and Products.</h4>—Notwithstanding the apparent
poverty of this desert soil, nature has not denied it the powers of
production; it is even favourable to some grains, especially the
bajra, which prefers a light sand. In a favourable season they
grow sufficient for the consumption of two and even three years,
and then they import only wheat from Sind. When those parts
favourable for bajra have been saturated with two or three heavy
showers, they commence sowing, and the crops spring up rapidly.
The great danger is that of too much rain when the crops are
advanced, for, having little tenacity, they are often washed away.
The <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>bajra</em></span> of the sand-hills is deemed far superior to that of Hindustan,
and prejudice gives it a preference even to wheat, which
does not bear a higher price, in times of scarcity. Bajra, in
plentiful seasons, sells at one and a half maunds for a rupee;<a id='r7.7.6' /><a href='#f7.7.6' class='c013'><sup>[6]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1248'>1248</span>but this does not often occur, as they calculate five bad seasons
for a good one. Juar is also grown, but only in the low flats.
Cotton is produced in the same soil as the bajra. It is not generally
known that this plant requires but a moderate supply of
water; it is deteriorated in the plains of India from over-irrigation;
at least such is the idea of the desert-farmer, who perhaps does
not make sufficient allowance for the cooler substratum of his
sand-hills, compared with the black loam of Malwa. A variety of
pulses grows on the sheltered sides of the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>tibas</em></span>, as <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>mung</em></span>, <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>moth</em></span>, etc.;
also the oil-plant (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>til</em></span>) and abundance of the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>gawar</em></span>, a diminutive
melon, not larger than a hen’s egg, which is sent hundreds of
miles, as a rarity. Around the capital, and between the ridges
where soil is deposited or formed, and where they dam up the
waters, are grown considerable quantities of wheat of very good
quality, turmeric, and garden-stuffs. Barley and gram are, in
good seasons, reared in small quantities, but rice is entirely an
article of import from the valley of Sind.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Implements of Husbandry.</h4>—Where the soil is light, it will be
concluded that the implements are simple. They have two kinds
of plough, for one or two oxen, or for the camel, which animal is
most in requisition. They tread out the grain with oxen, as in
all parts of India, and not unfrequently they yoke the cattle to
their hakerries,<a id='r7.7.7' /><a href='#f7.7.7' class='c013'><sup>[7]</sup></a> or carts, and pass the whole over the grain.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Manufactures.</h4>—There is little scope for the ingenuity of the
mechanic in this tract. They make coarse cotton cloths, but the
raw material is almost all exported. Their grand article of
manufacture is from the wool of the sheep pastured in the desert
[282], which is fabricated into <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>lois</em></span>, or blankets, scarfs,<a id='r7.7.8' /><a href='#f7.7.8' class='c013'><sup>[8]</sup></a> petticoats,
turbans, of every quality. Cups and platters are made from a
mineral called <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>abrak</em></span>, a calcareous substance, of a dark chocolate
ground, with light brown vermiculated stripes;<a id='r7.7.9' /><a href='#f7.7.9' class='c013'><sup>[9]</sup></a> female ornaments
of elephants’ teeth, and arms of an inferior quality. These
comprehend the artificial productions of this desert capital.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Commerce.</h4>—Whatever celebrity Jaisalmer possesses, as a
commercial mart, arises from its position as a place of transit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1249'>1249</span>between the eastern countries, the valley of the Indus, and those
beyond that stream, the Kitars (the term for a caravan of camels)
to and from Haidarabad, Rori-Bakhar, Shikarpur and Uchh,
from the Gangetic provinces, and the Panjab, passing through it.
The indigo of the Duab, the opium of Kotah and Malwa, the
famed sugar-candy of Bikaner, iron implements from Jaipur, are
exported to Shikarpur<a id='r7.7.10' /><a href='#f7.7.10' class='c013'><sup>[10]</sup></a> and lower Sind; whence elephants’
teeth (from Africa), dates, coco-nuts, drugs, and chandan,<a id='r7.7.11' /><a href='#f7.7.11' class='c013'><sup>[11]</sup></a> are
imported, with pistachios and dried fruits from Bahawalpur.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Revenues and Taxes.</h4>—The personal revenue of the princes of
Jaisalmer<a id='r7.7.12' /><a href='#f7.7.12' class='c013'><sup>[12]</sup></a> is, or rather was, estimated at upwards of four lakhs
of rupees, of which more than one lakh was from the land.<a id='r7.7.13' /><a href='#f7.7.13' class='c013'><sup>[13]</sup></a> The
transit duties were formerly the most certain and most prolific
branch of the fiscal income; but the bad faith of the minister, the
predatory habits of the Bhatti chiefs proceeding mainly from
thence, and the general decrease of commerce, have conspired
nearly to annihilate this source of income, said at one time to
reach three lakhs of rupees. These imposts are termed <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>dan</em></span>, and
the collector <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>dani</em></span>, who was stationed at convenient points of all
the principal routes which diverge from the capital.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Land-tax.</h4>—From one-fifth to one-seventh of the gross produce
of the land is set aside as the tax of the crown, never exceeding
the first nor falling short of the last.<a id='r7.7.14' /><a href='#f7.7.14' class='c013'><sup>[14]</sup></a> It is paid in kind, which is
purchased on the spot by the Paliwal Brahmans, or Banias, and
the value remitted to the treasury [283].</div>

<div class='section-start'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1250'>1250</span><h4 class='disp-inline'>Dhuan.</h4>—The third and now the most certain branch of
revenue is the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>dhuan</em></span>, literally ‘smoke,’ and which we may render
‘chimney or hearth-tax,’ though they have neither the one nor
the other in these regions. It is also termed <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>thali</em></span>, which is the
brass or silver platter out of which they eat, and is tantamount
to a table-allowance. It never realizes above twenty thousand
rupees annually, which, however, would be abundant for the
simple fare of Jaisalmer. No house is exempt from the payment
of this tax.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Dand.</h4>—There is an arbitrary tax levied throughout these
regions, universally known and detested under the name of <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>dand</em></span>,
the make-weight of all their budgets of ways and means. It was
first imposed in Jaisalmer in S. 1830 (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1774), under the less
odious appellation of ‘additional <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>dhuan</em></span> or <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>thali</em></span>,’ and the amount
was only two thousand seven hundred rupees, to be levied from
the monied interest of the capital. The Mahesris<a id='r7.7.15' /><a href='#f7.7.15' class='c013'><sup>[15]</sup></a> agreed to pay
their share, but the Oswals (the two chief mercantile classes)
holding out, were forcibly sent up to the castle, and suffered the
ignominious punishment of the bastinado. They paid the
demand, but immediately on their release entered into a compact
on oath, never again to look on the Rawal’s (Mulraj’s) face, which
was religiously kept during their mutual lives. When he passed
through the streets of his capital, the Oswals abandoned their
shops and banking-houses, retiring to the interior of their habitations
in order to avoid the sight of him. This was strenuously
persevered in for many years, and had such an effect upon the
prince, that he visited the principal persons of this class, and
‘spreading his scarf’ (<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>pala pasarna</em></span>),<a id='r7.7.16' /><a href='#f7.7.16' class='c013'><sup>[16]</sup></a> intreated forgiveness,
giving a writing on oath never again to impose <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>dand</em></span>, if they would
make the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>dhuan</em></span> a permanent tax. The Oswals accepted the
repentance of their prince, and agreed to his terms. In S. 1841
and 1852, his necessities compelling him to raise money, he
obtained by loan, in the first period, twenty-seven thousand,
and in the latter, forty thousand rupees, which he faithfully
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1251'>1251</span>repaid. When the father of the present minister came into
power, he endeavoured to get back the bond of his sovereign
abrogating the obnoxious <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>dand</em></span>, and offered, as a bait, to renounce
the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>dhuan</em></span>. The Oswals placed more value on the virtue of this
instrument than it merited, for in spite of the bond, he in S. 1857
levied sixty thousand, and in 1863, eighty thousand rupees. A
visit of the Rawal to the Ganges was seized upon as a fit opportunity
by his subjects to get this oppression redressed, and fresh
oaths were made by the prince, and broken by the minister, who
has bequeathed his rapacious spirit to his son [284].</div>

<p class='c001'>Since the accession of Gaj Singh, only two years ago,<a id='r7.7.17' /><a href='#f7.7.17' class='c013'><sup>[17]</sup></a> Salim
Singh has extorted fourteen lakhs (£140,000). Bardhman, a
merchant of great wealth and respectability, and whose ancestors
are known and respected throughout Rajwara as Sahukars, has
been at various times stripped of all his riches by the minister and
his father, who, to use the phraseology of the sufferers, “will
never be satisfied while a rupee remains in Jaisalmer.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The ministers and officers of government receive assignments
on the transit-duties, and some have lands. The whole of this
State-expenditure was more than covered, in some years, by the

almost incredible sum of three lakhs, or £30,000.</p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Tribes.</h4>—We shall conclude our account of Jaisalmer with a
few remarks on the [285] tribes peculiar to it; though we reserve
the general enumeration for a sketch of the desert.</div>

<p class='c001'>Of its Rajput population, the Bhattis, we have already given
an outline in the general essay on the tribes.<a id='r7.7.22' /><a href='#f7.7.22' class='c013'><sup>[22]</sup></a> Those which
occupy the present limits of Jaisalmer retain their Hindu notions,
though with some degree of laxity from their intercourse with the
Muhammadans on the northern and western frontiers; while
those which long occupied the north-east tracts, towards Phulra
and the Gara, on becoming proselytes to Islam ceased to have
either interest in or connexion with the parent State. The
Bhatti has not, at present, the same martial reputation as the
Rathor, Chauhan, or Sesodia, but he is deemed at least to equal
if not surpass the Kachhwaha, or any of its kindred branches,
Naruka or Shaikhavat. There are occasional instances of Bhatti
intrepidity as daring as may be found amongst any other tribe;
witness the feud between the chiefs of Pugal and Mandor. But
this changes not the national characteristic as conventionally
established; though were we to go back to the days of chivalry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1253'>1253</span>and Prithiraj, we should select Achalesa Bhatti, one of the bravest
of his champions, for the portrait of his race. The Bhatti Rajput,
as to physical power, is not perhaps so athletic as the Rathor, or
so tall as the Kachhwaha, but generally fairer than either, and
possessing those Jewish features which Mr. Elphinstone remarked
as characteristic of the Bikaner Rajputs. The Bhatti intermarries
with all the families of Rajwara, though seldom with the
Ranas of Mewar. The late Jagat Singh of Jaipur had five wives
of this stock, and his posthumous son, real or reputed, has a
Bhattiani for his mother.<a id='r7.7.23' /><a href='#f7.7.23' class='c013'><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Dress.</h4>—The dress of the Bhattis consists of a <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>jama</em></span>, or tunic of
white cloth or chintz reaching to the knee; the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>kamarband</em></span>, or
ceinture, tied so high as to present no appearance of waist;
trousers very loose, and in many folds, drawn tight at the ankle,
and a turban, generally of a scarlet colour, rising conically full
a foot from the head. A dagger is stuck in the waistband; a
shield is suspended by a thong of deer-skin from the left shoulder,
and the sword is girt by a belt of the same material. The dress
of the common people is the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>dhoti</em></span>, or loin-robe, generally of woollen
stuff, with a piece of the same material as a turban. The dress
of the Bhattianis, which discriminates the sex, consists of a
<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>ghaghra</em></span>, or petticoat, extending to thirty feet in width, made
generally of the finer woollen, dyed a brilliant red, with a scarf
of the same material. The grand ornament of rich and poor,
though varying in the materials, is the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>churi</em></span>, or rings of ivory or
bone, with which they cover their arms from the shoulder to
[286] the wrist.<a id='r7.7.24' /><a href='#f7.7.24' class='c013'><sup>[24]</sup></a> They are in value from sixteen to thirty-five
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1254'>1254</span>rupees a set, and imported from Maskat-Mandavi, though they
also manufacture them at Jaisalmer. Silver <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>karis</em></span> (massive rings
or anklets) are worn by all classes, who deny themselves the
necessaries of life until they attain this ornament. The poorer
Rajputnis are very masculine, and assist in all the details of
husbandry.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Use of Opium.</h4>—The Bhatti is to the full as addicted as any of
his brethren to the immoderate use of opium. To the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>amalpani</em></span>,
or ‘infusion,’ succeeds the pipe, and they continue inhaling
mechanically the smoke long after they are insensible to all that
is passing around them; nay, it is said, you may scratch or pinch
them while in this condition without exciting sensation. The
<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>hukka</em></span> is the dessert to the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>amalpani</em></span>; the panacea for all the ills
which can overtake a Rajput, and with which he can at any time
enjoy a paradise of his own creation. To ask a Bhatti for a whiff
of his pipe would be deemed a direct insult.</div>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Pāliwāls.</h4>—Next to the lordly Rajputs, equalling them in
numbers and far surpassing them in wealth, are the Paliwals.
They are Brahmans, and denominated Paliwal from having been
temporal proprietors of Pali, and all its lands, long before the
Rathors colonized Marwar. Tradition is silent as to the manner
in which they became possessed of this domain; but it is connected
with the history of the Pali, or pastoral tribes, who from
the town of Pali to Palitana, in Saurashtra, have left traces of
their existence;<a id='r7.7.25' /><a href='#f7.7.25' class='c013'><sup>[25]</sup></a> and I am much mistaken if it will not one day
be demonstrated, that all the ramifications of the races figuratively
denominated Agnikula, were Pali in origin; more especially
the Chauhans, whose princes and chiefs for ages retained the
distinctive affix of <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>pal</em></span>.</div>

<p class='c001'>These Brahmans, the Paliwals, as appears by the Annals of
Marwar, held the domain of Pali when Siahji, at the end of the
twelfth century, invaded that land from Kanauj, and by an act
of treachery first established his power.<a id='r7.7.26' /><a href='#f7.7.26' class='c013'><sup>[26]</sup></a> It is evident, however,
that he did not extirpate them, for the cause of their migration to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1255'>1255</span>the desert of Jaisalmer [287] is attributed to a period of a Muhammadan
invasion of Marwar, when a general war-contribution
(<span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>dand</em></span>) being imposed on the inhabitants, the Paliwals pleaded
caste, and refused. This exasperated the Raja; for as their
habits were almost exclusively mercantile, their stake was greater
than that of the rest of the community, and he threw their
principal men into prison. In order to avenge this, they had
recourse to a grand <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>chandni</em></span>, or ‘act of suicide’; but instead of
gaining their object, he issued a manifesto of banishment to every
Paliwal in his dominions. The greater part took refuge in
Jaisalmer, though many settled in Bikaner, Dhat, and the valley
of Sind. At one time their number in Jaisalmer was calculated
to equal that of the Rajputs. Almost all the internal trade of
the country passes through their hands, and it is chiefly with
their capital that its merchants trade in foreign parts. They are
the Metayers of the desert, advancing money to the cultivators,
taking the security of the crop; and they buy up all the wool
and <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>ghi</em></span> (clarified butter), which they transport to foreign parts.
They also rear and keep flocks. The minister, Salim Singh, has
contrived to diminish their wealth, and consequently to lose the
main support of the country’s prosperity. They are also subject
to the visits of the Maldots, Tejmallots, and other plunderers;
but they find it difficult to leave the country owing to the restrictive
cordon of the Mehta. The Paliwals never marry out of their
own tribe; and, directly contrary to the laws of Manu,<a id='r7.7.27' /><a href='#f7.7.27' class='c013'><sup>[27]</sup></a> the bridegroom
gives a sum of money to the father of the bride. It will be
deemed a curious incident in the history of superstition, that a
tribe, Brahman by name, at least, should worship the bridle of a
horse. When to this is added the fact that the most ancient coins
discovered in these regions bear the Pali character and the effigies
of the horse, it aids to prove the Scythic character of the early
colonists of these regions, who, although nomadic (Pali), were
equestrian. There is little doubt that the Paliwal Brahmans are
the remains of the priests of the Pali race, who, in their pastoral
and commercial pursuits, have lost their spiritual power.<a id='r7.7.28' /><a href='#f7.7.28' class='c013'><sup>[28]</sup></a></p>

<div class='section-start'><h4 class='disp-inline'>Pokharna Brāhmans.</h4>— Another singular tribe, also Brahmanical,
is the Pokharna, of whom it is calculated there are fifteen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1256'>1256</span>hundred to two thousand families in Jaisalmer. They are also
numerous in Marwar and Bikaner, and are scattered over the
desert and valley of the Indus. They follow agricultural and
pastoral pursuits chiefly, having little or no concern in trade.
The tradition of their origin is singular; it is said that they were
Beldars, and excavated the sacred lake of Pushkar or Pokhar, for
which act they obtained the favour of the deity and the grade of
Brahmans, with the title of Pokharna. Their chief object of
emblematic worship, the <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>kudala</em></span>, a kind of pick-axe used in
digging, seems to favour this tradition [288].<a id='r7.7.29' /><a href='#f7.7.29' class='c013'><sup>[29]</sup></a></div>

city is to the north, and is surrounded by a <span lang="hi" xml:lang="hi"><em>shahrpanah</em></span>, or circumvallation,
encompassing a space of nearly three miles, having
three gates and two wickets. In the city are some good houses
belonging to rich merchants, but the greater part consists of huts.

perhaps comparative.<a id='r7.7.30' /><a href='#f7.7.30' class='c013'><sup>[30]</sup></a> Were he on good terms with his vassalage,

left of this most antique fane, attributed to the age of Dagobert. It represents
the conversion of Clovis, and when the subject was still a matter of
novelty. But interesting as this is, it is as nothing when compared to some
sculptured figures below, of a totally distinct age; in execution as far

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
